  GK:  "Tue Jun 2 — Alisson is now widely expected to remain. Juventus had agreed personal terms near €5m a year, but the Italians missing out on Champions League football drained the move of momentum, and the Brazilian was never the one pushing it. Mamardashvili waits, likeliest to go out on loan.",
  LB:  "Tue Jun 2 — with Andy Robertson's free transfer to De Zerbi's Tottenham now done, the Liverpool left-back slot is unambiguously Milos Kerkez's after a tough first season at £45m. Nine years of cover at the position have walked out the door in a single window.",
  LCB: "Tue Jun 2 — Van Dijk closes a hard campaign as captain with his standards intact, named in Koeman's World Cup squad and contracted to June 2027 — the one fixed point as the back line is rebuilt around him, and the senior leader of a suddenly thin centre-back group.",
  RCB: "Tue Jun 9 — the succession finally has names: with Konaté's free move to Madrid sealed (the extension collapsed over wage and agent-fee demands, not football), Hughes and Iraola have drawn up a four-man shortlist, Sporting's left-footed Gonçalo Inácio (~£52m clause) the marquee fit, with Tottenham's Vuskovic, Forest's Murillo and Napoli's Beukema alongside and Club Brugge's Ordóñez (~£40m) the standing bid. Jacquet is the in-house cover until one lands.",
  LDM: "Tue Jun 2 — Gravenberch finished the season as the most consistent midfielder Liverpool had and is in the Dutch World Cup squad; the obvious building block at the base of the 4-2-3-1 going into 2026-27.",
  RDM: "Tue Jun 2 — Szoboszlai closes a heavy-minutes season of 48 appearances as a midfield mainstay; a contract extension is still expected to be agreed over the summer.",
  LAM: "Tue Jun 2 — Florian Wirtz ends an injury-disrupted, awkward first season at Liverpool — the £115m playmaker shared just 117 minutes on the pitch with Isak and Ekitike all year. The club is holding firm on keeping him; a clean pre-season is everything now.",
  CAM: "Tue Jun 9 — the Mac Allister question has not eased: Real Madrid and Atlético both remain linked, no new-contract talks open, the midfielder into the final two years of his deal. His father Carlos again denies a formal approach while allowing he views La Liga warmly; Football365 keeps Liverpool's internal sale valuation near €120m.",
  RAM: "Sun Jun 14 — the winger search has its near-agreement: on the eve of the window, Liverpool are reported to have agreed personal terms with Leipzig's Yan Diomandé, the 19-year-old leaning to Anfield over PSG and promised the right flank, only the club-to-club fee (Leipzig ~€130m, Reds ~€100m) still to settle. Bradley Barcola recedes to the later-window fallback Romano says 'movements are expected' around. The incumbent, Salah, plays on at the tournament as Egypt's captain, a free agent on June 30 weighing Juventus, Inter Miami and the Saudi money.",
  RB:  "Sun Jun 14 — the slot's exit grinds on: Inter and Liverpool stay 'locked in negotiations' over Jones, a ~€25m fee with a sell-on clause and a fresh meeting lined up to bridge the gap, while talks have been held over Leipzig right-back Lutsharel Geertruida (~£26m), the natural specialist cover for a position where Bradley's rehab is still indoors and Frimpong's first season never settled.",
  ST:  "Tue Jun 2 — Alexander Isak ends an injury-wrecked debut season — a string of setbacks limited the £100m striker to a handful of starts and never let Slot's intended front three settle. A full summer to reset before 2026-27.",
