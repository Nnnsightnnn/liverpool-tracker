export const SLOT_RATIONALE = {
  GK:  "Tue Jun 2 — Alisson is now widely expected to remain. Juventus had agreed personal terms near €5m a year, but the Italians missing out on Champions League football drained the move of momentum, and the Brazilian was never the one pushing it. Mamardashvili waits, likeliest to go out on loan.",
  LB:  "Tue Jun 2 — with Andy Robertson's free transfer to De Zerbi's Tottenham now done, the Liverpool left-back slot is unambiguously Milos Kerkez's after a tough first season at £45m. Nine years of cover at the position have walked out the door in a single window.",
  LCB: "Tue Jun 2 — Van Dijk closes a hard campaign as captain with his standards intact, named in Koeman's World Cup squad and contracted to June 2027 — the one fixed point as the back line is rebuilt around him, and the senior leader of a suddenly thin centre-back group.",
  RCB: "Tue Jun 9 — the succession finally has names: with Konaté's free move to Madrid sealed (the extension collapsed over wage and agent-fee demands, not football), Hughes and Iraola have drawn up a four-man shortlist, Sporting's left-footed Gonçalo Inácio (~£52m clause) the marquee fit, with Tottenham's Vuskovic, Forest's Murillo and Napoli's Beukema alongside and Club Brugge's Ordóñez (~£40m) the standing bid. Jacquet is the in-house cover until one lands.",
  LDM: "Tue Jun 2 — Gravenberch finished the season as the most consistent midfielder Liverpool had and is in the Dutch World Cup squad; the obvious building block at the base of the 4-2-3-1 going into 2026-27.",
  RDM: "Tue Jun 2 — Szoboszlai closes a heavy-minutes season of 48 appearances as a midfield mainstay; a contract extension is still expected to be agreed over the summer.",
  LAM: "Tue Jun 2 — Florian Wirtz ends an injury-disrupted, awkward first season at Liverpool — the £115m playmaker shared just 117 minutes on the pitch with Isak and Ekitike all year. The club is holding firm on keeping him; a clean pre-season is everything now.",
  CAM: "Wed Jun 17 — the denial gets louder: Mac Allister's father and agent Carlos has again branded the exit talk 'false,' insisting no approaches were declined because none were made, even as Liverpool stay quietly open to a sale near €120m if funds are needed. Real Madrid hold the warmest interest in a midfielder with two years left and no extension talks open, a fork pointed against Gravenberch's fresh terms.",
  RAM: "Wed Jun 17 — the winger search reaches its endgame: Liverpool are reported 'closing in' on Diomandé, in daily talks and readying a bid this week, with the 19-year-old hinting he is 'about to sign' and PSG unable to answer until they sell; Leipzig have lifted their ask from €100m toward €130m on a deal to 2030. The incumbent, Salah, a free agent on June 30, has been ruled out of a Premier League return as he weighs Turkey, Saudi money and an MLS reunion after the World Cup.",
  RB:  "Wed Jun 17 — the slot's exit hinges on a number: Inter sporting director Ausilio has gone public on Jones and an opening proposal is in, but it sits short of Liverpool's ~€35m ask against Inter's near-€20m valuation; the only Merseyside-born player is 'totally open' to leaving. Leipzig right-back Lutsharel Geertruida (~£26m) remains the specialist cover floated for a position where Bradley is out until next season and Frimpong's first year never settled.",
  ST:  "Tue Jun 2 — Alexander Isak ends an injury-wrecked debut season — a string of setbacks limited the £100m striker to a handful of starts and never let Slot's intended front three settle. A full summer to reset before 2026-27.",
