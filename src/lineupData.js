export const SLOT_RATIONALE = {
  GK:  "Tue Jun 2 — Alisson is now widely expected to remain. Juventus had agreed personal terms near €5m a year, but the Italians missing out on Champions League football drained the move of momentum, and the Brazilian was never the one pushing it. Mamardashvili waits, likeliest to go out on loan.",
  LB:  "Tue Jun 2 — with Andy Robertson's free transfer to De Zerbi's Tottenham now done, the Liverpool left-back slot is unambiguously Milos Kerkez's after a tough first season at £45m. Nine years of cover at the position have walked out the door in a single window.",
  LCB: "Tue Jun 2 — Van Dijk closes a hard campaign as captain with his standards intact, named in Koeman's World Cup squad and contracted to June 2027 — the one fixed point as the back line is rebuilt around him, and the senior leader of a suddenly thin centre-back group.",
  RCB: "Tue Jun 9 — the succession finally has names: with Konaté's free move to Madrid sealed (the extension collapsed over wage and agent-fee demands, not football), Hughes and Iraola have drawn up a four-man shortlist, Sporting's left-footed Gonçalo Inácio (~£52m clause) the marquee fit, with Tottenham's Vuskovic, Forest's Murillo and Napoli's Beukema alongside and Club Brugge's Ordóñez (~£40m) the standing bid. Jacquet is the in-house cover until one lands.",
  LDM: "Tue Jun 2 — Gravenberch finished the season as the most consistent midfielder Liverpool had and is in the Dutch World Cup squad; the obvious building block at the base of the 4-2-3-1 going into 2026-27.",
  RDM: "Tue Jun 2 — Szoboszlai closes a heavy-minutes season of 48 appearances as a midfield mainstay; a contract extension is still expected to be agreed over the summer.",
  LAM: "Tue Jun 2 — Florian Wirtz ends an injury-disrupted, awkward first season at Liverpool — the £115m playmaker shared just 117 minutes on the pitch with Isak and Ekitike all year. The club is holding firm on keeping him; a clean pre-season is everything now.",
  CAM: "Wed Jun 17 — the denial gets louder: Mac Allister's father and agent Carlos has again branded the exit talk 'false,' insisting no approaches were declined because none were made, even as Liverpool stay quietly open to a sale near €120m if funds are needed. Real Madrid hold the warmest interest in a midfielder with two years left and no extension talks open, a fork pointed against Gravenberch's fresh terms.",
  RAM: "Sat Jun 27 — the replacement idles on a number: personal terms are agreed with Yan Diomandé, but the deal has hardened into a fee fight, Leipzig digging in near £112m and content to keep the 19-year-old a year longer unless their figure arrives, while the player leans on his club and PSG hover. The incumbent leaves into the unknown: Salah was withdrawn at 57' with his hamstring strapped as Egypt drew Iran and reached the World Cup last 32 for the first time, a tie with Australia to come and his Anfield exit four days off. Trincão and Barcola idle as the wider winger options.",
  RB:  "Sat Jun 27 — the search finally turns to names of its own: after watching Chelsea move first for Atalanta's Palestra, Liverpool are now sounding Inter's Denzel Dumfries, who carries a release clause, and Leipzig's Lutsharel Geertruida (as low as ~£17m), with an insider this week saying plainly that change is needed on the flank. Bradley's knee rehab is still indoors with no return date and Frimpong is cast as a backup. Jones, now staying after a second Inter bid was rejected, remains emergency cover here.",
  ST:  "Tue Jun 2 — Alexander Isak ends an injury-wrecked debut season — a string of setbacks limited the £100m striker to a handful of starts and never let Slot's intended front three settle. A full summer to reset before 2026-27.",

  level: "Low",
  reason: "Sat Jun 27 — the XI is still the side that closed 2025-26 after the May 24 1-1 with Brentford, held as the baseline while Andoni Iraola's rebuild trades around it. The freshest news is at the World Cup: Salah was withdrawn at 57' with his hamstring strapped as Egypt drew Iran and reached the last 32 for the first time in their history, a tie with Australia next and his Anfield exit due on June 30 (the camp call the injury precautionary). In the market the priority deal has hardened into a fee fight: personal terms are agreed with Yan Diomandé, but Leipzig are digging in near £112m while the teenager leans on his club and PSG hover. The long-ignored right-back search finally moved, the Reds sounding Inter's Denzel Dumfries (release clause) and Leipzig's Geertruida after Chelsea got to Palestra first. Confidence stays Low until more bodies arrive and the World Cup contingent returns: the centre-back board has Inácio leading after Konaté's confirmed Madrid exit and the loss of Marc Guéhi to Manchester City, while Camavinga (~£52m) idles on the player's reluctance. Jones is staying after a second Inter bid was rejected; Endo is home injured and Szoboszlai absent from the finals, so reintegration will be staggered. The season's calendar is set: a daunting opener at Newcastle on August 23. Next fixture: pre-season vs Sunderland in Nashville, July 25.",
