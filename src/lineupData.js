export const SLOT_RATIONALE = {
  GK:  "Tue Jun 2 — Alisson is now widely expected to remain. Juventus had agreed personal terms near €5m a year, but the Italians missing out on Champions League football drained the move of momentum, and the Brazilian was never the one pushing it. Mamardashvili waits, likeliest to go out on loan.",
  LB:  "Tue Jun 2 — with Andy Robertson's free transfer to De Zerbi's Tottenham now done, the Liverpool left-back slot is unambiguously Milos Kerkez's after a tough first season at £45m. Nine years of cover at the position have walked out the door in a single window.",
  LCB: "Tue Jun 2 — Van Dijk closes a hard campaign as captain with his standards intact, named in Koeman's World Cup squad and contracted to June 2027 — the one fixed point as the back line is rebuilt around him, and the senior leader of a suddenly thin centre-back group.",
  RCB: "Tue Jun 9 — the succession finally has names: with Konaté's free move to Madrid sealed (the extension collapsed over wage and agent-fee demands, not football), Hughes and Iraola have drawn up a four-man shortlist, Sporting's left-footed Gonçalo Inácio (~£52m clause) the marquee fit, with Tottenham's Vuskovic, Forest's Murillo and Napoli's Beukema alongside and Club Brugge's Ordóñez (~£40m) the standing bid. Jacquet is the in-house cover until one lands.",
  LDM: "Tue Jun 2 — Gravenberch finished the season as the most consistent midfielder Liverpool had and is in the Dutch World Cup squad; the obvious building block at the base of the 4-2-3-1 going into 2026-27.",
  RDM: "Tue Jun 2 — Szoboszlai closes a heavy-minutes season of 48 appearances as a midfield mainstay; a contract extension is still expected to be agreed over the summer.",
  LAM: "Tue Jun 2 — Florian Wirtz ends an injury-disrupted, awkward first season at Liverpool — the £115m playmaker shared just 117 minutes on the pitch with Isak and Ekitike all year. The club is holding firm on keeping him; a clean pre-season is everything now.",
  CAM: "Wed Jun 17 — the denial gets louder: Mac Allister's father and agent Carlos has again branded the exit talk 'false,' insisting no approaches were declined because none were made, even as Liverpool stay quietly open to a sale near €120m if funds are needed. Real Madrid hold the warmest interest in a midfielder with two years left and no extension talks open, a fork pointed against Gravenberch's fresh terms.",
  RAM: "Wed Jun 24 — the replacement has its breakthrough: Liverpool have agreed personal terms with Yan Diomandé and, with PSG reported to have stepped back, hold a clear run, an aggressive second bid above €100m loading after the opener was rejected. The incumbent, meanwhile, leaves on a high: Salah tops Group G with Egypt and faces Iran on Friday, his next club now open between a framed Fenerbahce deal and fresh Saudi interest. Barcola stays the warm alternative, discussed every week, and Munoz is already in from Osasuna for wide cover.",
  RB:  "Wed Jun 24 — open, but unresolved: Liverpool have rejected Inter's second bid (~£21.7m) as well short of their ~£35-40m valuation, yet Jones is reported still 'totally open' to leaving, the Reds torn between cashing in on a year-left deal and keeping him. The slot's natural pieces remain Bradley (out until next season) and Frimpong (an unsettled first year), with Leipzig right-back Lutsharel Geertruida (~£26m) specialist cover should a right-back be added.",
  ST:  "Tue Jun 2 — Alexander Isak ends an injury-wrecked debut season — a string of setbacks limited the £100m striker to a handful of starts and never let Slot's intended front three settle. A full summer to reset before 2026-27.",

The priority winger chase has its breakthrough: Liverpool have agreed personal terms with Yan Diomandé and, with PSG stepping back, hold a clear run, an aggressive second bid above €100m loading after the €100m opener was rejected. A new midfield name landed too, contact made for West Ham's £85m Mateus Fernandes. Confidence stays Low until more bodies arrive and the World Cup contingent returns: the first arrival, Munoz, is in from Osasuna; the patient centre-back plan lost Marc Guéhi to Manchester City, leaving Inácio and Ordóñez to carry the board, while Konaté's Real Madrid unveiling nears. Salah, a free agent on June 30, tops Group G with Egypt and faces Iran on Friday. Endo is home injured and Szoboszlai absent from the finals, so reintegration will be staggered. The opener is a daunting trip to Newcastle on August 23. Next fixture: pre-season vs Sunderland in Nashville, July 25.",
