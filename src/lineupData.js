  LCB: "Tue Sep 29, morning - the Dutch camp released Gakpo to Liverpool's medical staff on Monday; the captain stays on for Greece and Serbia. No doubt about the slot: every league minute bar the cup night, three clean sheets in a row. Haaland is the first opponent back.",
  RCB: "Tue Sep 29, morning - a first France cap in Brussels, ninety minutes, a 1-0 win and a clean sheet beside Lacroix. Jacquet goes into City having conceded no league goal for Liverpool in September and none for his country on debut. High.",
  RB: "Tue Sep 29, morning - ninety minutes in Uruguay's 4-1 win in Seoul, booked, eleven defensive contributions per Rush The Kop. Five straight league starts out of position and three clean sheets; Frimpong remains the alternative. Semenyo is the winger to handle.",
  LDM: "Tue Sep 29, morning - ninety minutes in Belfast, a goalless draw, no knock. With the front line thinning, Rousing The Kop's bolder City shape keeps him beside Mac Allister and Gravenberch; in the base 4-2-3-1 the pivot is his.",
  RDM: "Tue Sep 29, morning - with Argentina, untouched by the week's injuries, and the renewal he wants is now Julian Ward's decision. Undroppable on current evidence.",
  LAM: "Tue Sep 29, morning - seventy-seven lively minutes on the left for France in Brussels, per the club's round-up, and now the one certainty in an attack without Gakpo, per Rousing The Kop. Still without a league goal. The slot is his; the question is who plays opposite him.",
  CAM: "Tue Sep 29, morning - with Germany. Sports Mole's 47 per cent drop-off piece is the case against; Gakpo's injury is the case for, and one Monday preview moves Wirtz forward rather than out. Holds the slot pending October team news.",
  RAM: "Tue Sep 29, morning - Gakpo out: his ankle is with the scanners, the reporting spanning a fortnight to a possible surgery. Munoz holds the slot on this sheet, ready for either flank per Sports Mole, but GiveMeSport expects Iraola to unleash Ngumoha here. Low.",
  ST: "Tue Sep 29, morning - Low for fitness, and the stakes only rise. Isak's thigh is still 'a small problem' in Graham Potter's words and he holds the slot on that reading, but with Gakpo's ankle in for a scan, the fallback is Koumas, reported ready for a full league debut, or Munoz moved central.",
