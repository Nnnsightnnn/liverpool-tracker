// Default formation when entering the view: the 4-2-3-1 Iraola has used in every league game,
// now pointed at Manchester City at home on Sunday 11 October, 4.30pm at Anfield. This is no
// longer a predicted XI assembled from previews. It is the eleven that beat Bournemouth 1-0 on 20 September, confirmed by ESPN and the BBC: Alisson in goal, Van Dijk and Jacquet at centre-back,
// Araujo out of position at right-back, Kerkez at left-back, Szoboszlai and Mac Allister the pivot,
// Gakpo right, Wirtz at the ten, Barcola left, Isak through the middle. Three weeks of international
// football sit between this sheet and the fixture, so it is a baseline rather than a forecast.
// Mon Sep 28 (evening): one forced change from that eleven, Munoz for Gakpo (ankle, reported several weeks).
// Mon Oct 5 (evening): Jacquet (left hamstring strain with France) becomes a doubt at RCB; held pending assessment.
// Tue Oct 6 (morning): no personnel change. The FFF sent Jacquet back with no timeline; Haaland reported fit for City.
// Tue Oct 6 (evening): no personnel change. Jacquet's strain reported as slight (Zidane; Liverpool Echo via Yahoo), RCB raised Low to Medium.
// Wed Oct 7 (morning): no personnel change. Window over, Mac Allister last home (79 minutes of Messi's farewell, VAVEL); still no club word on Jacquet, Isak or Gakpo.
