  GK:  "Tue Jun 2 — Alisson is now widely expected to remain. Juventus had agreed personal terms near €5m a year, but the Italians missing out on Champions League football drained the move of momentum, and the Brazilian was never the one pushing it. Mamardashvili waits, likeliest to go out on loan.",
  LB:  "Tue Jun 2 — with Andy Robertson's free transfer to De Zerbi's Tottenham now done, the Liverpool left-back slot is unambiguously Milos Kerkez's after a tough first season at £45m. Nine years of cover at the position have walked out the door in a single window.",
  LCB: "Tue Jun 2 — Van Dijk closes a hard campaign as captain with his standards intact, named in Koeman's World Cup squad and contracted to June 2027 — the one fixed point as the back line is rebuilt around him, and the senior leader of a suddenly thin centre-back group.",
  RCB: "Tue Jun 9 — the succession finally has names: with Konaté's free move to Madrid sealed (the extension collapsed over wage and agent-fee demands, not football), Hughes and Iraola have drawn up a four-man shortlist, Sporting's left-footed Gonçalo Inácio (~£52m clause) the marquee fit, with Tottenham's Vuskovic, Forest's Murillo and Napoli's Beukema alongside and Club Brugge's Ordóñez (~£40m) the standing bid. Jacquet is the in-house cover until one lands.",
  LDM: "Tue Jun 2 — Gravenberch finished the season as the most consistent midfielder Liverpool had and is in the Dutch World Cup squad; the obvious building block at the base of the 4-2-3-1 going into 2026-27.",
  RDM: "Tue Jun 2 — Szoboszlai closes a heavy-minutes season of 48 appearances as a midfield mainstay; a contract extension is still expected to be agreed over the summer.",
  LAM: "Tue Jun 2 — Florian Wirtz ends an injury-disrupted, awkward first season at Liverpool — the £115m playmaker shared just 117 minutes on the pitch with Isak and Ekitike all year. The club is holding firm on keeping him; a clean pre-season is everything now.",
  CAM: "Tue Jun 16 — the Mac Allister file stirs: Romano reports interested clubs are 'starting to look at the situation,' the midfielder into the final two years of his deal with no extension talks open. Real Madrid and Atlético hold the warmest interest; Liverpool's internal sale valuation sits near €120m, the sell-to-buy fuel for any midfield reshape.",
  RAM: "Tue Jun 16 — the winger search tilts red: Romano reports Liverpool have cleared the squad space the Diomandé deal needs and now hold the advantage over a PSG side with 'many moving parts,' though Leipzig still will not sell the 19-year-old below ~€130m on a deal to 2030 with no clause. The incumbent, Salah, played on at the World Cup, assisting Egypt's opener on his 34th birthday before a 1-1 draw with Belgium; a free agent on June 30, his market still tilts to Turkey ahead of the Saudi money, an Inter Miami reunion and Juventus.",
  RB:  "Tue Jun 16 — the slot's exit nears: Inter are closing on a ~€25m deal for Jones with a sell-on clause, the only Merseyside-born player having waved off Villa, Newcastle and Forest, while Leipzig right-back Lutsharel Geertruida (~£26m) is the specialist cover floated for a position where Bradley's rehab is still indoors and Frimpong's first season never settled.",
  ST:  "Tue Jun 2 — Alexander Isak ends an injury-wrecked debut season — a string of setbacks limited the £100m striker to a handful of starts and never let Slot's intended front three settle. A full summer to reset before 2026-27.",
