export const SLOT_RATIONALE = {
  GK:  "Tue Jun 2 — Alisson is now widely expected to remain. Juventus had agreed personal terms near €5m a year, but the Italians missing out on Champions League football drained the move of momentum, and the Brazilian was never the one pushing it. Mamardashvili waits, likeliest to go out on loan.",
  LB:  "Tue Jun 2 — with Andy Robertson's free transfer to De Zerbi's Tottenham now done, the Liverpool left-back slot is unambiguously Milos Kerkez's after a tough first season at £45m. Nine years of cover at the position have walked out the door in a single window.",
  LCB: "Wed Jul 1 — the fixed point is suddenly a question: Galatasaray are readying an official offer for the 34-year-old captain, reported open to leaving on a free, though Liverpool insist they will not sanction a fourth senior exit after Salah, Konaté and Robertson. Named in Koeman's World Cup squad and contracted to 2027, he closed the campaign with his standards intact and remains, for now, the man a thinning back line is rebuilt around.",
  RCB: "Tue Jun 9 — the succession finally has names: with Konaté's free move to Madrid sealed (the extension collapsed over wage and agent-fee demands, not football), Hughes and Iraola have drawn up a four-man shortlist, Sporting's left-footed Gonçalo Inácio (~£52m clause) the marquee fit, with Tottenham's Vuskovic, Forest's Murillo and Napoli's Beukema alongside and Club Brugge's Ordóñez (~£40m) the standing bid. Jacquet is the in-house cover until one lands.",
  LDM: "Tue Jun 2 — Gravenberch finished the season as the most consistent midfielder Liverpool had and is in the Dutch World Cup squad; the obvious building block at the base of the 4-2-3-1 going into 2026-27.",
  RDM: "Tue Jun 2 — Szoboszlai closes a heavy-minutes season of 48 appearances as a midfield mainstay; a contract extension is still expected to be agreed over the summer.",
  LAM: "Tue Jun 2 — Florian Wirtz ends an injury-disrupted, awkward first season at Liverpool — the £115m playmaker shared just 117 minutes on the pitch with Isak and Ekitike all year. The club is holding firm on keeping him; a clean pre-season is everything now.",
  CAM: "Wed Jun 17 — the denial gets louder: Mac Allister's father and agent Carlos has again branded the exit talk 'false,' insisting no approaches were declined because none were made, even as Liverpool stay quietly open to a sale near €120m if funds are needed. Real Madrid hold the warmest interest in a midfielder with two years left and no extension talks open, a fork pointed against Gravenberch's fresh terms.",
  RAM: "Wed Jul 1 — the replacement search runs into a wall: having lost Diomandé to PSG, Liverpool made fresh contact with Bradley Barcola's camp, but the reporting now frames the France winger as not for sale and only one of six on the club's wishlist. The incumbent leaves into the unknown: a free agent since yesterday, Salah nurses a confirmed hamstring strain that clouds his Egypt last-32 tie with Australia in Dallas on Friday. Ngumoha, this week tied to a new long-term deal, is part of the post-Salah picture.",
  RB:  "Wed Jul 1 — the search finds a marquee name: reporting has Liverpool ready to offer around £80m for Barcelona's Jules Koundé, a right-back raised as a centre-back and cover for both, a far bigger swing than the Dumfries and Geertruida names floated last week. Bradley's knee rehab is still indoors with no return date and Frimpong is cast as a backup. Jones, drawing a moneyed Nottingham Forest alongside Inter's, remains emergency cover here.",
  ST:  "Tue Jun 2 — Alexander Isak ends an injury-wrecked debut season — a string of setbacks limited the £100m striker to a handful of starts and never let Slot's intended front three settle. A full summer to reset before 2026-27.",

Today the summer's biggest tremor reaches the anchor of that XI: Galatasaray are readying an official offer for captain Virgil van Dijk on a free, and though Liverpool insist a fourth senior exit after Salah, Konaté and Robertson is out of the question, the noise unsettles a defence already light. The forward business answers the losses: an ~£80m move weighed for Barcelona's versatile Jules Koundé at right-back, Bradley Barcola kept atop a six-man winger board though the reporting now calls him not for sale, a Sandro Tonali hijack that flared and cooled, and a warming No. 6 file on Lille's Bouaddi. FSG moved to tie teenager Rio Ngumoha to a new long-term deal. Salah, a free agent since yesterday, nurses a confirmed hamstring strain that leaves Egypt sweating on him for Friday's last-32 tie with Australia in Dallas. Confidence stays Low until bodies arrive and the World Cup contingent filters back. Pre-season reports July 13; the opener is a daunting trip to Newcastle on August 23.
