  summary:
    "Thursday Apr 23 — Crystal Palace (H) -2 days — and the Liverpool news cycle has lurched in a brand-new direction overnight. Liverpool FC's own website confirms Liverpool and Chelsea have declared formal interest in Manchester City's James Trafford, with Goal/Sports Mole adding Tottenham, Newcastle and Aston Villa to a five-club race for the 23-year-old who lost his starting spot to Donnarumma in September. That story landed alongside a worrying Fabrizio Romano bombshell on Empire of the Kop and Yardbarker: 'Alisson likes the idea' of a Juventus return, with the Bianconeri having reached a verbal agreement and Alisson's Liverpool future now openly in question despite the recently-triggered 2027 extension. On the in-squad front, This Is Anfield says Liverpool are now the 'most likely' destination for free-agent Marcos Senesi (Slot's left-footed Feyenoord favourite), while a longer This Is Anfield piece argues Liverpool need SIX summer signings to get back on top. Slot's job, meanwhile, is locked in for 2026-27 per Sky Sports News (Apr 22) — Champions League qualification effectively sealing it. Yan Diomande remains the £87m+ top target with PSG now the rival; Konaté's new deal is 'nearing completion' per Romano (Apr 20). Sunday's 2-1 Hill Dickinson derby win — Van Dijk's 100th-minute header, Salah equalling Gerrard's 9 PL derby goals — is the backdrop, and Opta still has Liverpool at ~69% for top-five UCL qualification with Wharton fit to face them at Anfield.",

City want to keep him into 2026-27 but won't block an exit if he asks.
