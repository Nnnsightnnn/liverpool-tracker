// TWO-TRACK PIPELINE (see docs/COVER-IMAGE-PIPELINE.md):

  // (Sports Mole) to a possible high ankle sprain and surgery, eight to ten weeks (Physio Scout via CaughtOffside), with
  // Rik Elfrink's several weeks from the Eindhoven examination in between; City on 11 October beyond him either way. Also:

  // Plate carried, all 8 generatedAt 08:30Z.
  // Evening pass (Mon 28 September, ~6pm ET): NO MATCH, international break. The lead moves from scan day to its answer:

  // fuller 'very sad'/'that's perfect' interview, Van Dijk's Netherlands commitment to Euro 2028, Foden's ban

  // Morning pass (Tue 22 September, ~4am ET): NO MATCH, international break. The lead is the Florian Wirtz row:
  // Andoni Iraola defending him to Sky Sports ('much happier with his second half than his first') and calling
  // Klopp's split-squad decision 'very smart', with Wirtz answering the criticism on Instagram ('Into the
  // international break with a win'). Second surface is the right-back file gaining two fresh January-shaped names,

  // Evening pass (Mon 21 September, 6pm ET): NO MATCH, international break. The lead is Alexis Mac Allister
  // telling ESPN there is "no firm decision" on a Liverpool contract the club has declined to open talks about,
  // with Jamie Carragher's call to drop Florian Wirtz for Manchester City the evening's second surface. Both are
  // interviews. NO new image queued under STEP 7.5: neither a contract stand-off nor a podcast verdict resolves

  // candidate for a future plate remains Jeremy Jacquet. Szoboszlai plate carried, generatedAt re-stamped only.
  // Previous evening pass (Sun 20 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): MATCH PLAYED. Bournemouth 0-1 Liverpool at the Vitality,
  // Isak turning in a blocked Gakpo cross on 57 for a third consecutive Premier League clean sheet, a rise from
  // tenth to sixth, and Iraola the first Liverpool manager unbeaten in his opening five league games since Joe

  // Morning pass (Sun 20 September, ~4am ET): MATCHDAY. Bournemouth away at 2pm at the Vitality, unplayed at the time of
  // writing, so the Szoboszlai plate is carried and generatedAt re-stamped only. The lead rotated off Saturday's table
  // movement onto the game itself: Iraola's first return to the club he managed for three years, the game in hand finally
  // paid, and the one live team-news question being Cody Gakpo's adductor doubt ('I cannot guarantee it', per This Is
  // Anfield). A matchday preview is not a single photographable still, so NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5;

  // Liverpool tenth. All eight generatedAt stamps 08:30Z.
  // Evening pass (Sat 19 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): still no Liverpool match since Tuesday's cup tie, so the
  // Szoboszlai plate is carried and generatedAt re-stamped only. The lead rotated off the morning's homecoming-eve
  // preview onto Saturday's five Premier League results, which dropped Liverpool from eighth to tenth without them
  // playing: Brighton 3-0 Arsenal ended the champions' perfect start, Everton and Newcastle won, Coventry took a
  // first points and first goal at Forest, and Tottenham scored for the first time and lost 3-2 to Villa anyway.
  // The club also confirmed Chelsea at Anfield in the Carabao Cup fourth round on 28 October and the Champions
  // League trip to LASK on 14 October. A league table rearranging itself is not a single photographable still, so

  // Morning pass (Sat 19 September, ~4am ET): no match since Tuesday's cup tie and the international break now open, so

  // call-up onto the eve of Sunday's fixture: Iraola's homecoming to Bournemouth, team news locked and the predicted league
  // XI settled, the last soft game before City, Brentford, Brighton and Arsenal. A matchday-eve build-up is not a single

  // Evening pass (Fri 18 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): no match since Tuesday's cup tie, so the Szoboszlai plate is
  // carried and generatedAt re-stamped only. The lead rotated off the morning's homecoming preview onto Rio Ngumoha's
  // call-up to Thomas Tuchel's England squad, announced Friday morning, plus Iraola's 1.30pm press conference. A squad

  // Morning pass (Fri 18 September, ~4am ET): no match since Tuesday's cup tie, so the Szoboszlai volley plate is

  // Evening pass (Thu 17 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): no match since Tuesday's cup tie, so the Szoboszlai
  // volley plate is carried and generatedAt re-stamped only. The lead rotated off the cup draw onto Thursday's
  // squad decision: Liverpool have put Wataru Endo up for sale for January, six competitive games into Iraola's
  // first season, with Ben Jacobs the source under CaughtOffside, Football365, TeamTalk, SportBible and
  // Sportskeeda; the counterweight is the push to tie Rio Ngumoha to a new long-term deal inside a month.
  // A transfer-list decision and a contract negotiation are not single photographable stills, so NO new image
  // was queued under STEP 7.5. All eight generatedAt stamps 22:30Z.
  // Evening/overnight pass (started Wed 16 September 6pm ET, published Thu 17 September): no match since
  // Tuesday's cup tie, so the Szoboszlai volley plate is carried and generatedAt re-stamped only. The lead
  // rotated onto the Carabao Cup fourth-round draw, made at Old Trafford on Wednesday night: Liverpool host
  // Chelsea in the week commencing 26 October, Xabi Alonso back at Anfield a third autumn running with a
  // third club. A cup draw is not a single photographable still, so NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5.
  // Morning pass (Wed 16 September, ~4am ET): no match since Tuesday's cup tie, so the Szoboszlai volley plate is carried
  // and generatedAt re-stamped only. The lead rotated off the raw 3-1 result onto Sunday: Iraola's homecoming to Bournemouth,
  // read through the scrutiny around him (unbeaten yet 'under serious pressure' per Yahoo/LiveScore, Hughes gone to Al-Hilal),
  // with tonight's Carabao Cup fourth-round draw the day's other fixed point. A homecoming preview and a cup draw are not

  // Table byte-identical from ESPN, Liverpool eighth. All eight generatedAt stamps 08:30Z.
  // Evening pass (Tue 15 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): a match was played, and it leads every surface.
  // Liverpool 3-1 Tottenham at Anfield, Carabao Cup third round, with TEN changes and Joe Gomez captaining
  // on a first appearance since a July muscle injury. Mac Allister into the top corner on 21; Gakpo the
  // second shortly after the interval; Gallagher headed Spurs back into it from a corner before the 70th;
  // Mamardashvili, in his first appearance of the season, made a significant late save; Szoboszlai, off the
  // bench, volleyed the third from around thirty yards in stoppage time. Andy Robertson came on for Udogie
  // on 57 and was given a standing ovation from all four stands on his first Anfield return. Fans also spotted
  // Iraola passing his own match notes down the bench to the academy players. First win since Ipswich and the
  // first time this season Liverpool have scored three. NO expected-goals figures had been published at the
  // time of writing, so the FORM_TRENDS card for this tie carries nulls with pending: true rather than an
  // estimate. NEXT_MATCH rolled to Bournemouth away, Sunday 20 September, 2pm at the Vitality, Sky Sports
  // Main Event, Andoni Iraola's first return to the club he managed until the summer; the OPPOSITION dossier
  // was rebuilt from scratch for Marco Rose's side, the first team in Premier League history to lead in each
  // of its opening four fixtures and win none of them. Fourth-round draw Wednesday night after Man Utd vs
  // Brighton, ties in the week beginning 26 October. STANDINGS byte-identical from ESPN, Liverpool eighth.
  // A thirty-yard volley IS a photographable moment under STEP 7.5, so a Track 1 plate was generated (the
  // strike, no text) and the Track 2 brief below is the open request for Antigravity. All eight generatedAt
  // stamps 22:45Z.
  // Morning pass (Tue 15 September, ~4am ET): MATCHDAY, but the match is tonight and has not been played, so there is no
  // new photographable moment yet. The Jacquet plate is carried again and generatedAt re-stamped; the `focus`/`brief`
  // below still describe the Fulham clearance, now the edition's background rather than its lead. The lead rotated off
  // Monday's press conference onto the tie itself: Tottenham at Anfield, 8pm, the Carabao Cup third round and Iraola's
  // first domestic cup tie, a heavily rotated XI (Koumas through the middle behind a returning Gakpo, Ngumoha and Munoz
  // wide, Nyoni and Mac Allister screening, Isak/Van Dijk/Szoboszlai/Wirtz rested), with Andy Robertson's first return to
  // Anfield in Tottenham colours the night's sub-plot. No new image queued under STEP 7.5 (a pre-match preview is not a
  // single still); Antigravity may generate a post-match hero image tonight if the tie produces one. Table unchanged from
  // ESPN, Liverpool eighth. All eight generatedAt stamps 08:30Z.
  // Evening pass (Mon 14 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): no match since Saturday, so the Jacquet plate is carried and
  // generatedAt re-stamped only. The `focus` line and `brief` below still describe the Fulham clearance, which is now the
  // third story on the page. The lead rotated to Iraola's Monday press conference at the AXA: Mamardashvili confirmed to
  // start (a first appearance of the season, the manager volunteering that he tried to sign him for Bournemouth), Gomez
  // upgraded from doubt to 'available for tomorrow', and the manager's own account of a schedule he called the worst
  // scenario. A press conference has no single still photograph in it, so NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5 and the
  // brief below is intentionally left at the last genuinely photographable moment; Antigravity should treat it as served.
  // Also this pass: Tottenham's team news reversed the weekend's reading (Tonali out with a knock, Porro and Kulusevski
  // out, Richarlison excluded from the squad entirely, Udogie back, Van de Ven in fact fit and a starter at Everton), and
  // the table moved without Liverpool playing, Leeds beating Newcastle 4-1 at Elland Road to go third and Liverpool
  // slipping from seventh to eighth on the same six points.
  // Machine-readable handoff written by the daily run, consumed by Antigravity.
  // Evening pass (Sat 12 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): a match was played. Liverpool 0-0 Fulham at Anfield,
  // the first blank under Iraola and a fourth straight Anfield league draw, the first such run since November
  // 2011 per Opta. Jacquet cleared Garcia's shot off the line on 12 after Alisson's short pass to a marked
  // Gravenberch (King's penalty appeal waved away); Munoz headed a corner against the bar on 22; Leno saved
  // from Isak and Mac Allister; Alisson tipped King's curler wide on 76; Muniz missed on 79. Opta: 1.13 xG from
  // 14 shots to 0.71 from 10. Three changes (Tsimikas, Gravenberch, Munoz) all withdrawn by the hour; Gakpo back
  // from the bench; Gomez not in the squad. Iraola: 'a lack of freshness, definitely, we cannot hide it'.
  // The result leads every surface. Next: Tottenham, Carabao Cup third round, Anfield, Tuesday 8pm, ITV and
  // Sky; NEXT_MATCH rolled forward and the OPPOSITION dossier rebuilt for De Zerbi's goalless side. A goal-line
  // clearance IS a photographable moment under STEP 7.5, so a Track 1 plate was generated (the clearance, no
  // text) and the Track 2 brief below is the open request for Antigravity (COVER-00001). The limn-editor-enhance
  // skill was not present on this mount, so the request is recorded here and in cover-brief.json only.
  // Morning pass (Sat 12 September): MATCHDAY. Fulham at Anfield today at 3pm; no match or ruling-out
  // since Wednesday's Atletico win, table byte-identical from ESPN. Lead rotated off Friday evening's
  // Ekitike-January anchor onto the fixture itself; Gakpo the lone doubt into matchday, Barcola and Kerkez
  // cleared, Gomez in line for a first bench. Mac Allister strike plate carried and re-stamped.
  // Morning pass (Sun 13 September, ~4am ET): no match since Saturday; table byte-identical from ESPN (the
  // Manchester derby is this afternoon, unplayed). Lead rotated off the Fulham result onto the Sunday-morning
  // reckoning on Iraola: 'officially under serious pressure' (AnfieldWatch/LiveScore/Yahoo) after one win in
  // four, with no sporting director (Hughes long gone to Al-Hilal, Gordon/FSG hunting a fifth since 2022), his
  // fuller 'what was lacking was quite clear' post-mortem, and Pablo Barrios (Atletico) the one new January/
  // summer midfield thread. NOT a sacking; contradiction sweep clean. A manager-pressure lead is not
  // photographable, so no new image queued; Jacquet clearance plate carried and generatedAt re-stamped.
  // Evening pass (Sun 13 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): no match since Saturday, so the Jacquet plate is carried
  // and generatedAt re-stamped only. NOTE: the `focus` line above and the `brief` below still describe the Fulham
  // clearance, which is now the SECOND story on the page, not the lead. The lead rotated to the captain's contract:
  // Liverpool will not open Van Dijk talks until 2027, no decision before April, the deal expiring that summer
  // (Football Insider, carried by Yahoo / CaughtOffside / Sports Mole). A contract that is deliberately not being
  // discussed has no single still photograph in it, so NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5 and the brief below
  // is intentionally left at the last genuinely photographable moment. Antigravity should treat it as already served.
  // The table moved without Liverpool playing: City won the derby with ten men, Brighton won 5-0 at Coventry,
  // Liverpool slip to seventh on the same six points.
  // Evening pass (Fri 11 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): no match since Wednesday. The lead moved to the one
  // new fact from Friday's briefing: Iraola put a January date, of sorts, on Ekitike's Achilles. Plate carried.
  // Evening pass (Wed 9 September): a match was played. Liverpool 2-1 Atletico Madrid at Anfield, the Champions
  // League opener: Llorente 17, Szoboszlai 40, Mac Allister 50. Opta: 1.68 xG from 14 shots to 0.81 from 9.

Liverpool's sixth place is one goal of difference short of the Europa stripe Leeds hold and three short of Brentford's Champions League one. The first league game back is City at Anfield, and the three after it, Brentford, Brighton and Arsenal, are also against sides above Liverpool. Coventry, Fulham and Tottenham are the bottom three, and Bournemouth, seventeenth, have still not won.",

    "Arsenal": "Second on twelve, three behind City, with the league's lowest expected goals against, 0.81 a game per Opta; at Anfield on 1 November.",
    "Brighton": "Third on ten with the best goal difference in the division, plus eleven; Liverpool's visitors on 25 October.",

In Saint-Denis, Al Jazeera's predicted France XI to face Italy has Jeremy Jacquet at centre-back and Bradley Barcola on the left, with Kylian Mbappe out with a knee problem and Manchester City's Gianluigi Donnarumma in the Italian goal.

    "Two of City's spine are previewed on opposite sides in Saint-Denis tonight: Rayan Cherki in Al Jazeera's predicted France midfield and Gianluigi Donnarumma in Italy's goal, with Liverpool's Jacquet and Barcola in the same France side as Cherki. Erling Haaland's window so far has been a quiet night in Cardiff, where Norway lost 2-1 to Wales on Thursday (Y Clwb Pel-droed). Off the grass the verdict on 114 of the 115 charges is still the backdrop, with Keith Wyness's speculation that Enzo Maresca has clauses that could take him out in June if sanctions are severe (Football Insider via Football365). On it, City are first on fifteen, five from five in Maresca's first season after Pep Guardiola, though Opta's expected-points model, via Read Man City, puts them second behind Arsenal. Their Anfield list runs to four names, from the last game of Phil Foden's ban to Antoine Semenyo's swollen leg, and Sunderland's three goals and 3.57 expected at the Etihad remain the best evidence that this City concede.",
  shape:
    "Maresca has kept the possession spine and loosened everything in front of it, which is why City look like a scoring machine and a defensive argument at the same time. The back four sits high with Gvardiol at left-back stepping into midfield and Matheus Nunes giving width on the right; Enzo Fernandez and Elliot Anderson screen in a double pivot that is more about ball progression than protection. Rayan Cherki plays between the lines and carries, with Antoine Semenyo and Iliman Ndiaye on the flanks and Haaland pinning the centre-backs. The pattern that beat Sunderland twice over and nearly cost them the afternoon is the same one: when the ball turns over in City's half, the space between that high line and Donnarumma is enormous, and Sunderland needed very little invitation to run into it three times on 20 September.",

The counterpart is Liverpool's own weakness: nine fast-break goals conceded since the start of last season, the most in the league (Opta), on a right flank where Araujo, a centre-half, has started five straight league games, and Semenyo's swollen leg decides how hard that side is tested.

  depthRisk: [
    { position: "Right-back", level: "high", detail: "Still the department with no answer inside the building, though its incumbent came through Monday in good order: Araujo played ninety minutes of Uruguay's 4-1 win in Seoul, booked, eleven defensive contributions (Rush The Kop). Ronald Araujo, a centre-half by trade, has started five consecutive league games at right-back and the BBC's verdict at Bournemouth was that he defends the position comfortably but offers little going forward, the accurate summary of a working compromise. The department does not get deeper for three months: Conor Bradley's knee has no club date and FotMob's listing pushes him to early January 2027, Frimpong, cut from the Dutch 23 for Serbia on Sunday, is the cup alternative, Gomez is the only specialist and stays at the AXA through the break. Manchester City attack that flank with Antoine Semenyo, who withdrew from Ghana's window with a swollen leg and is a minor doubt (Sports Mole). The movement this week was reportorial and doubled: Liverpool are linked with Benfica's eighteen-year-old Daniel Banjaqui at a reported 50m euros (Anfield Watch via CaughtOffside) and Feyenoord's Givairo Read (TeamTalk), both January-shaped projects rather than September solutions. The injury this week came one layer down: Isaac Mabaya, a twenty-one-year-old right-back who plays for the Under-21s, withdrew from Zimbabwe's squad with a groin problem sustained in the Under-21s' win over Brighton on 19 September (This Is Anfield / Nehanda Radio)." },
    { position: "Centre-forward", level: "critical", detail: "Still critical, and Friday morning brought no bulletin to change that. The better news is two days old: Lewis Koumas started at nine for Wales in a 2-1 win over Norway and drew a 7/10 from Y Clwb Pel-droed, troubled by the Norwegian centre-backs' physicality but good with the ball on the floor; and L'Equipe, via CaughtOffside and repeated in Friday's Blood Red, reports Ekitike targeting team training in November and matchday squads in December, unconfirmed by the club. Neither changes City: Isak, scorer of four of seven league goals, has had no bulletin on the foot and thigh the club calls minor, Gakpo, the first cover at nine, is reported out for several weeks, and Chiesa has not played since August. If Isak is not right, Koumas makes a full league debut against the leaders, or Munoz is tried centrally, as Rousing The Kop suggests. No market until January." },
    { position: "Centre-back", level: "medium", detail: "Healthy. Jacquet is in Al Jazeera's predicted France XI for Italy tonight, a likely second cap, and Van Dijk played the left of the Dutch defence in Thessaloniki rather than the right (Goal ratings), headed a goal on his 99th cap and came through the 2-2 unhurt (AP), after a first half he called not good enough. He and Jacquet have kept three consecutive league clean sheets, and the club's Opta review has Jacquet at 76.9 per cent in aerial duels. The longer question is the captain's contract, which ends in summer 2027 with no renewal offered: Real Madrid weighing a free transfer (Mundo Deportivo via Goal), Galatasaray said to be ready to approach in January and Bastoni tracked as a successor (AnfieldWatch via LiveScore). Behind the pair, Gomez is fit, Araujo covers, Leoni's group return is unconfirmed, and Endo, the emergency fifth, is listed for January." },
    { position: "Left-back", level: "high", detail: "Unchanged in level. Kerkez is expected at left-back for Hungary against Georgia tonight (Sports Mole), then Ukraine on Monday; Tsimikas, who called Thursday's 2-2 with the Netherlands a 'valuable' point (AP), goes to Germany on Sunday and will face Wirtz. The last club game is still the evidence: Kerkez started against the club that sold him and the BBC's report says he struggled initially and was targeted over the top, praised for effort rather than quality. Two senior options, neither of whom the reporting rates at the manager's standard, no market until January, and Semenyo attacking that side on 11 October if his leg clears." },
    { position: "Wide forward", level: "critical", detail: "Critical since Monday, and tonight Barcola is expected on France's left against Italy (Al Jazeera), the one senior wide forward in action this weekend. Gakpo's ankle, reported as several weeks, takes out the player who started on the right at Bournemouth and created three chances, and leaves Barcola, Munoz and Ngumoha to cover two flanks against City, LASK and Brentford. On Tuesday night Ngumoha came on for Saka in England's 2-0 win in Prague, the third-youngest competitive England player at eighteen years and thirty-one days (Sports Mole), and Munoz came off the bench in Spain's 4-1 win over Croatia (Liverpool FC), so both deputies return with minutes. Chiesa's end-of-month target for group training lapsed on 30 September without confirmation, Inter are reported to be weighing January (AnfieldWatch via LiveScore), and he is still the only reinforcement in sight." },
    { position: "Central midfield", level: "medium", detail: "Medium on availability. Szoboszlai is in Hungary's predicted side against Georgia tonight (Sports Mole); Gravenberch did not start in Thessaloniki on Thursday, coming on at half-time at 2-0 down with Lang and Reijnders, and Goal's 6 credited him with 'better ball retention and physical presence', a mild answer to Wednesday's Dutch criticism (TEAMtalk). He has not started any of Liverpool's last three league games. Mac Allister and Szoboszlai are the pivot; Mac Allister, with Argentina until 6 October, is running down a deal the club has not offered to extend, and Sports Mole and Goal report interest in Inter's Aleksandar Stankovic, with the BBC placing Liverpool among clubs interested in Bournemouth's Alex Scott (Empire of the Kop). Endo is listed for January and Nyoni, nineteen, is the other cover." },

Six points from those four would leave Liverpool on fifteen from nine, 1.67 a game and a Europa-band pace; nine or more and sixty-eight starts to look earned rather than borrowed from a soft opening. Three or fewer and the unbeaten start becomes a footnote. City will be played without Gakpo on every reading in print, and with Isak only if he trains next week.",
