// ─── Cover Image (edition hero — tied to the lead story) ────────────────────
// The cover renders `src` full-bleed behind the masthead with a legibility
// scrim; if `src` is null or the file fails to load, the cover falls back to
// the pure-type masthead. `generatedAt` doubles as a cache-buster (?v=).
//
// TWO-TRACK PIPELINE (see docs/COVER-IMAGE-PIPELINE.md):
//   • The daily liverpool-tracker-update run regenerates a deterministic SVG
//     "editorial plate" (public/assets/cover/*.svg) from the lead story, so the
//     cover always has a visual, and writes `brief` below.
//   • Antigravity ("agy") reads `brief`, generates a premium photographic image
//     when the lead is genuinely visual, drops the JPG in public/assets/cover/,
//     and repoints `src` + `credit` + `generatedAt` at it.
// `focus` is the one-line "most important focus of the latest edition."

  // tenth to sixth, and Iraola the first Liverpool manager unbeaten in his opening five league games since Joe

  // movement onto the game itself: Iraola's first return to the club he managed for three years, the game in hand finally
  // paid, and the one live team-news question being Cody Gakpo's adductor doubt ('I cannot guarantee it', per This Is
  // Anfield). A matchday preview is not a single photographable still, so NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5;

  // Liverpool tenth. All eight generatedAt stamps 08:30Z.
  // Evening pass (Sat 19 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): still no Liverpool match since Tuesday's cup tie, so the
  // Szoboszlai plate is carried and generatedAt re-stamped only. The lead rotated off the morning's homecoming-eve
  // preview onto Saturday's five Premier League results, which dropped Liverpool from eighth to tenth without them
  // playing: Brighton 3-0 Arsenal ended the champions' perfect start, Everton and Newcastle won, Coventry took a
  // first points and first goal at Forest, and Tottenham scored for the first time and lost 3-2 to Villa anyway.
  // The club also confirmed Chelsea at Anfield in the Carabao Cup fourth round on 28 October and the Champions
  // League trip to LASK on 14 October. A league table rearranging itself is not a single photographable still, so

  // Morning pass (Sat 19 September, ~4am ET): no match since Tuesday's cup tie and the international break now open, so

  // call-up onto the eve of Sunday's fixture: Iraola's homecoming to Bournemouth, team news locked and the predicted league
  // XI settled, the last soft game before City, Brentford, Brighton and Arsenal. A matchday-eve build-up is not a single

  // Evening pass (Fri 18 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): no match since Tuesday's cup tie, so the Szoboszlai plate is

  // call-up to Thomas Tuchel's England squad, announced Friday morning, plus Iraola's 1.30pm press conference. A squad
  // list read out in London is not a single photographable still, so NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5.
  // Morning pass (Fri 18 September, ~4am ET): no match since Tuesday's cup tie, so the Szoboszlai volley plate is

  // to Bournemouth, previewed on the day of his 1.30pm press conference and the last fixture before the international

  // Evening pass (Thu 17 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): no match since Tuesday's cup tie, so the Szoboszlai
  // volley plate is carried and generatedAt re-stamped only. The lead rotated off the cup draw onto Thursday's
  // squad decision: Liverpool have put Wataru Endo up for sale for January, six competitive games into Iraola's
  // first season, with Ben Jacobs the source under CaughtOffside, Football365, TeamTalk, SportBible and
  // Sportskeeda; the counterweight is the push to tie Rio Ngumoha to a new long-term deal inside a month.
  // A transfer-list decision and a contract negotiation are not single photographable stills, so NO new image
  // was queued under STEP 7.5. All eight generatedAt stamps 22:30Z.
  // Evening/overnight pass (started Wed 16 September 6pm ET, published Thu 17 September): no match since
  // Tuesday's cup tie, so the Szoboszlai volley plate is carried and generatedAt re-stamped only. The lead
  // rotated onto the Carabao Cup fourth-round draw, made at Old Trafford on Wednesday night: Liverpool host
  // Chelsea in the week commencing 26 October, Xabi Alonso back at Anfield a third autumn running with a
  // third club. A cup draw is not a single photographable still, so NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5.
  // Morning pass (Wed 16 September, ~4am ET): no match since Tuesday's cup tie, so the Szoboszlai volley plate is carried
  // and generatedAt re-stamped only. The lead rotated off the raw 3-1 result onto Sunday: Iraola's homecoming to Bournemouth,
  // read through the scrutiny around him (unbeaten yet 'under serious pressure' per Yahoo/LiveScore, Hughes gone to Al-Hilal),
  // with tonight's Carabao Cup fourth-round draw the day's other fixed point. A homecoming preview and a cup draw are not
  // single photographable stills, so NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5; the Szoboszlai plate stands as the carried hero.
  // Table byte-identical from ESPN, Liverpool eighth. All eight generatedAt stamps 08:30Z.
  // Evening pass (Tue 15 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): a match was played, and it leads every surface.
  // Liverpool 3-1 Tottenham at Anfield, Carabao Cup third round, with TEN changes and Joe Gomez captaining
  // on a first appearance since a July muscle injury. Mac Allister into the top corner on 21; Gakpo the
  // second shortly after the interval; Gallagher headed Spurs back into it from a corner before the 70th;
  // Mamardashvili, in his first appearance of the season, made a significant late save; Szoboszlai, off the
  // bench, volleyed the third from around thirty yards in stoppage time. Andy Robertson came on for Udogie
  // on 57 and was given a standing ovation from all four stands on his first Anfield return. Fans also spotted
  // Iraola passing his own match notes down the bench to the academy players. First win since Ipswich and the
  // first time this season Liverpool have scored three. NO expected-goals figures had been published at the
  // time of writing, so the FORM_TRENDS card for this tie carries nulls with pending: true rather than an
  // estimate. NEXT_MATCH rolled to Bournemouth away, Sunday 20 September, 2pm at the Vitality, Sky Sports
  // Main Event, Andoni Iraola's first return to the club he managed until the summer; the OPPOSITION dossier
  // was rebuilt from scratch for Marco Rose's side, the first team in Premier League history to lead in each
  // of its opening four fixtures and win none of them. Fourth-round draw Wednesday night after Man Utd vs
  // Brighton, ties in the week beginning 26 October. STANDINGS byte-identical from ESPN, Liverpool eighth.
  // A thirty-yard volley IS a photographable moment under STEP 7.5, so a Track 1 plate was generated (the
  // strike, no text) and the Track 2 brief below is the open request for Antigravity. All eight generatedAt
  // stamps 22:45Z.
  // Morning pass (Tue 15 September, ~4am ET): MATCHDAY, but the match is tonight and has not been played, so there is no
  // new photographable moment yet. The Jacquet plate is carried again and generatedAt re-stamped; the `focus`/`brief`
  // below still describe the Fulham clearance, now the edition's background rather than its lead. The lead rotated off
  // Monday's press conference onto the tie itself: Tottenham at Anfield, 8pm, the Carabao Cup third round and Iraola's
  // first domestic cup tie, a heavily rotated XI (Koumas through the middle behind a returning Gakpo, Ngumoha and Munoz
  // wide, Nyoni and Mac Allister screening, Isak/Van Dijk/Szoboszlai/Wirtz rested), with Andy Robertson's first return to
  // Anfield in Tottenham colours the night's sub-plot. No new image queued under STEP 7.5 (a pre-match preview is not a
  // single still); Antigravity may generate a post-match hero image tonight if the tie produces one. Table unchanged from
  // ESPN, Liverpool eighth. All eight generatedAt stamps 08:30Z.
  // Evening pass (Mon 14 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): no match since Saturday, so the Jacquet plate is carried and
  // generatedAt re-stamped only. The `focus` line and `brief` below still describe the Fulham clearance, which is now the
  // third story on the page. The lead rotated to Iraola's Monday press conference at the AXA: Mamardashvili confirmed to
  // start (a first appearance of the season, the manager volunteering that he tried to sign him for Bournemouth), Gomez
  // upgraded from doubt to 'available for tomorrow', and the manager's own account of a schedule he called the worst
  // scenario. A press conference has no single still photograph in it, so NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5 and the
  // brief below is intentionally left at the last genuinely photographable moment; Antigravity should treat it as served.
  // Also this pass: Tottenham's team news reversed the weekend's reading (Tonali out with a knock, Porro and Kulusevski
  // out, Richarlison excluded from the squad entirely, Udogie back, Van de Ven in fact fit and a starter at Everton), and
  // the table moved without Liverpool playing, Leeds beating Newcastle 4-1 at Elland Road to go third and Liverpool
  // slipping from seventh to eighth on the same six points.
  // Machine-readable handoff written by the daily run, consumed by Antigravity.
  // Evening pass (Sat 12 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): a match was played. Liverpool 0-0 Fulham at Anfield,
  // the first blank under Iraola and a fourth straight Anfield league draw, the first such run since November
  // 2011 per Opta. Jacquet cleared Garcia's shot off the line on 12 after Alisson's short pass to a marked
  // Gravenberch (King's penalty appeal waved away); Munoz headed a corner against the bar on 22; Leno saved
  // from Isak and Mac Allister; Alisson tipped King's curler wide on 76; Muniz missed on 79. Opta: 1.13 xG from
  // 14 shots to 0.71 from 10. Three changes (Tsimikas, Gravenberch, Munoz) all withdrawn by the hour; Gakpo back
  // from the bench; Gomez not in the squad. Iraola: 'a lack of freshness, definitely, we cannot hide it'.
  // The result leads every surface. Next: Tottenham, Carabao Cup third round, Anfield, Tuesday 8pm, ITV and
  // Sky; NEXT_MATCH rolled forward and the OPPOSITION dossier rebuilt for De Zerbi's goalless side. A goal-line
  // clearance IS a photographable moment under STEP 7.5, so a Track 1 plate was generated (the clearance, no
  // text) and the Track 2 brief below is the open request for Antigravity (COVER-00001). The limn-editor-enhance
  // skill was not present on this mount, so the request is recorded here and in cover-brief.json only.
  // Morning pass (Sat 12 September): MATCHDAY. Fulham at Anfield today at 3pm; no match or ruling-out
  // since Wednesday's Atletico win, table byte-identical from ESPN. Lead rotated off Friday evening's
  // Ekitike-January anchor onto the fixture itself; Gakpo the lone doubt into matchday, Barcola and Kerkez
  // cleared, Gomez in line for a first bench. Mac Allister strike plate carried and re-stamped.
  // Morning pass (Sun 13 September, ~4am ET): no match since Saturday; table byte-identical from ESPN (the
  // Manchester derby is this afternoon, unplayed). Lead rotated off the Fulham result onto the Sunday-morning
  // reckoning on Iraola: 'officially under serious pressure' (AnfieldWatch/LiveScore/Yahoo) after one win in
  // four, with no sporting director (Hughes long gone to Al-Hilal, Gordon/FSG hunting a fifth since 2022), his
  // fuller 'what was lacking was quite clear' post-mortem, and Pablo Barrios (Atletico) the one new January/
  // summer midfield thread. NOT a sacking; contradiction sweep clean. A manager-pressure lead is not
  // photographable, so no new image queued; Jacquet clearance plate carried and generatedAt re-stamped.
  // Evening pass (Sun 13 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): no match since Saturday, so the Jacquet plate is carried
  // and generatedAt re-stamped only. NOTE: the `focus` line above and the `brief` below still describe the Fulham
  // clearance, which is now the SECOND story on the page, not the lead. The lead rotated to the captain's contract:
  // Liverpool will not open Van Dijk talks until 2027, no decision before April, the deal expiring that summer
  // (Football Insider, carried by Yahoo / CaughtOffside / Sports Mole). A contract that is deliberately not being
  // discussed has no single still photograph in it, so NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5 and the brief below
  // is intentionally left at the last genuinely photographable moment. Antigravity should treat it as already served.
  // The table moved without Liverpool playing: City won the derby with ten men, Brighton won 5-0 at Coventry,
  // Liverpool slip to seventh on the same six points.
  // Evening pass (Fri 11 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): no match since Wednesday. The lead moved to the one
  // new fact from Friday's briefing: Iraola put a January date, of sorts, on Ekitike's Achilles. Plate carried.
  // Evening pass (Wed 9 September): a match was played. Liverpool 2-1 Atletico Madrid at Anfield, the Champions
  // League opener: Llorente 17, Szoboszlai 40, Mac Allister 50. Opta: 1.68 xG from 14 shots to 0.81 from 9.
  // Track 1 plate 2026-09-09-mac-allister-strike.svg.

    "A table that has not moved since matchday five spent Saturday being argued about anyway. Manchester City, top on fifteen and perfect, had their chairman insist that nothing has changed after reports that an independent commission found them guilty on 114 of 115 Premier League charges; until a sanction is set, and one may be a long while coming, the order below is simply the order, three points to Arsenal and five to Brighton. Liverpool sit sixth on nine inside a four-way tie with Brentford, Leeds and Everton, and outside the Europa stripe only because Leeds are one goal better off. The grass resumes on 11 October, when City come to Anfield to begin a run of four straight league fixtures against the sides above Liverpool. At the foot Tottenham remain last on two, still waiting for a first league win.",

    "Arsenal": "Second on twelve, three behind City, idle like everyone else through the break, having led the division a week ago. They visit Anfield on 1 November, after Liverpool have played City, Brentford and Brighton.",
    "Brighton": "Third on ten with the division's best goal difference and its most goals, sixteen, and two players, Pascal Gross and Charalampos Kostoulas, on September's shortlist. At Anfield on 25 October.",
    "Brentford": "Fourth on nine, unbeaten in five, the last club inside the Champions League stripe, with Kevin Schade on September's Player of the Month shortlist. Liverpool visit on 17 October.",
    "Leeds": "Fifth on nine and drawing the Europa stripe, five games unbeaten, with Jayden Bogle shortlisted for September. They hold the place ahead of Liverpool on a goal difference of plus four to plus three.",
    "Hull": "Eighth on eight, a promoted side in the top half, with Mohamed Belloumi on September's Player of the Month shortlist.",
    "Everton": "Seventh on nine, also unbeaten, also level with Liverpool, and separated from them by nothing except the order the table puts them in.",

    "Sunderland": "Fourteenth on four after scoring three at the Etihad and losing anyway, Brian Brobbey taking a hat-trick out of a defeat.",
    "Bournemouth": "Seventeenth on three, and beaten at home by Liverpool without scoring. It is the ninth time in the club's history they have failed to win any of their opening five league games, and only under Iraola in 2023-24 have they endured a longer winless start in the Premier League.",
    "Fulham": "Nineteenth on two after a draw with Manchester United, still inside the relegation stripe, and still carrying the point taken at Anfield on 12 September as a third of their season's return.",
    "Tottenham": "Bottom on two after five league games without a win, and beaten at Anfield in the Carabao Cup on 15 September.",

  summary:
    "Saturday night at Wembley supplied the evening's Liverpool story by leaving Liverpool out of it: Rio Ngumoha and Victor Munoz, billed this morning as opponents, were both cut from their matchday squads under UEFA's 23-man cap, and Spain won 3-2 with two of their goals coming from errors by Manchester City's Marc Guehi and Nico O'Reilly, per Sky Sports, a fortnight before City come to Anfield. City's chairman answered the reported 114-charge verdict on Saturday with a defiant 'nothing has changed' and a vow to prove the club's innocence, with no sanction yet set. Closer to home, Szoboszlai and Kerkez were booked in a mass brawl at the end of Hungary's defeat to Ukraine, and a former refereeing chief expects the federations, not the players, to be charged. Iraola, sixth and unbeaten, spends Sunday at Anfield watching the Women's Merseyside derby, fifteen days before his own side meets City there.",

  summary:
    "Saturday night at Wembley was a scouting report Liverpool did not have to commission. Two of City's back line were at fault as England lost 3-2 to Spain, per Sky Sports: Marc Guehi's second-minute blunder let Lamine Yamal through for the opener, and Nico O'Reilly's error on the hour set up Alex Baena's equaliser, while Elliot Anderson gave the ball away for the chance Ferran Torres sent wide on twenty-seven. The same day the club's chairman, Khaldoon Al Mubarak, answered reports that an independent commission has found City guilty of 114 of the 115 Premier League charges over their 2009 to 2018 finances with a defiant 'nothing has changed', no sanction set and an appeal to come, and Algeria sent the unused left-back Rayan Ait-Nouri home after he refused to warm up. It changes the mood around this fixture, not the fixture itself. On the grass the argument is the one their record still refuses to admit: Opta's expected-points model, reported by Read Man City, has City second rather than first after five games, their fifteen points 5.8 more than the chances created and conceded would usually earn, with Sunderland's 3.57 expected goals at the Etihad the third-highest by a losing side since 2013-14. The mitigation is genuine, a league-high 52.5 per cent of minutes spent in front. Phil Foden serves the last game of a three-match domestic ban at Anfield, and Haaland, Dias and Khusanov are among Maresca's players away with their countries. City are otherwise whole, first on fifteen, five wins from five, three clear of Arsenal, in their first season since 2015-16 without Pep Guardiola, who resigned in the summer and was replaced on 29 June by Enzo Maresca. Last time out they beat Sunderland 5-3 at the Etihad after being pegged back twice inside the opening half-hour, and Maresca's verdict was that there were too many goals and he would prefer to win 1-0. Before that: a 1-0 at home to Coventry, a 4-1 at Crystal Palace, a 2-1 over Bournemouth, and the derby win at Old Trafford in which Foden was sent off. The record flatters a team not yet under control, and now a club found in breach on the fullest scale the league has charged.",
  shape:
    "Maresca has kept the possession spine and loosened everything in front of it, which is why City look like a scoring machine and a defensive argument at the same time. The back four sits high with Gvardiol at left-back stepping into midfield and Matheus Nunes giving width on the right; Enzo Fernandez and Elliot Anderson screen in a double pivot that is more about ball progression than protection. Rayan Cherki plays between the lines and carries, with Antoine Semenyo and Iliman Ndiaye on the flanks and Haaland pinning the centre-backs. The pattern that beat Sunderland twice over and nearly cost them the afternoon is the same one: when the ball turns over in City's half, the space between that high line and Donnarumma is enormous, and Sunderland needed very little invitation to run into it three times last weekend.",

Against Liverpool specifically he has three goals in six meetings, one of his leaner records, but the division's leading scorer arriving at a back line that has kept three clean sheets is the single clearest question of the fixture.",

The brace changed his job description within a day: with Omar Marmoush gone to Tottenham, Maresca has identified him as the alternative to Haaland through the middle, which Semenyo said this week came as news to him ('I've heard about his backup striker thing. I don't know where it's come from! If I need to, then I'll do it').

  liverpoolAngle:
    "Wembley added a footnote on Saturday: the turnover-and-run pattern that Sunderland used three times at the Etihad was how Spain opened England up, and the first defender beaten was Marc Guehi, who is in the XI previews expect at Anfield. Opta's expected-points model supplies the wider argument: a City defence that allowed 2.82 expected goals across four clean sheets and 3.57 in a single afternoon is a defence that concedes chances, and Liverpool's problem this season has been finishing rather than creating them. The suspension does Liverpool a quiet favour: without Foden, City lose one of the attackers most comfortable receiving between the lines, which leaves Rayan Cherki as the seam-runner the fixture turns on, with Jeremy Doku, only just back from a calf problem, the wide threat still building sharpness. Liverpool arrive unbeaten, three clean sheets in a row, and with an expected-goals-against of 6.12 that only Arsenal and Nottingham Forest have bettered, per Opta; City arrive having scored five at home and conceded three to a promoted side on the same afternoon. The meeting point is the weakness each has failed to fix. Liverpool have conceded nine fast-break goals since the start of last season, the most in the league per Opta, and the department that gives them up is still the right, where Ronald Araujo, a centre-half by trade, has now started five consecutive league games out of position and where the only specialist alternatives are a knee whose listing has drifted to early 2027 and a cup selection. Semenyo attacks that side, and has just been told he is Haaland's understudy through the middle as well. City, for their part, leave an enormous gap between a high line and Donnarumma whenever the ball turns over, and Sunderland ran into it three times last weekend. Liverpool's recurring failure is finishing rather than creating, which is the thing Isak's four goals in five games have begun to answer and the thing Carragher has spent the week arguing Wirtz cannot. The honest reading is that the side with the better underlying defensive numbers is the one that has drawn three of five, and the side with the perfect record is the one its own manager says concedes too much. Neither will see most of its players again until the week of the game.",

    "Six days and one Wembley evening on from Bournemouth, the numbers in this column are the only thing about Liverpool's season that has not been argued over, and they still read two ways. Liverpool's defence is one of the three best in England by Opta's measure, an expected-goals-against of 6.12 bettered only by Arsenal (4.04) and Nottingham Forest (4.8), and only Leeds and Everton, on three apiece, have conceded fewer actual goals than the four Liverpool have. Alisson sits fifth in the division for save percentage at 77.8, worth 0.8 goals prevented on the expected-goals-on-target model. The attack is the unresolved half: 7.57 expected goals made and seven scored, four of them Isak's, a side that scores roughly what it creates and creates too much of it through one man. The opponent's reading is unchanged too: Opta's expected-points model still rates City's fifteen points 5.8 above their chances, which makes 11 October less about stopping a machine than about punishing a leaky one. Note the provenance gap, because it matters: the per-match column below sums to 5.92 against, slightly under Opta's published season total of 6.12, and the difference is between two ways of counting rather than a correction to either.",

    "Manchester City's fifteen points are 5.8 more than their chances would normally earn on Opta's expected-points model, which puts them second rather than first on the underlying table; Sunderland's 3.57 expected goals in defeat at the Etihad was the third-highest by a losing side since 2013-14 (via Read Man City).",

  depthRisk: [
    { position: "Right-back", level: "high", detail: "Still the department with no answer inside the building, and this week it acquired two names outside one. Ronald Araujo, a centre-half by trade, has started five consecutive league games at right-back and the BBC's verdict at Bournemouth was that he defends the position comfortably but offers little going forward, the accurate summary of a working compromise. The department does not get deeper for three months: Conor Bradley's knee has no club date and FotMob's listing pushes him to early January 2027, Frimpong is the cup alternative, Gomez is the only specialist and stays at the AXA through the break. Manchester City attack that flank with Antoine Semenyo. The movement this week was reportorial and doubled: Liverpool are linked with Benfica's eighteen-year-old Daniel Banjaqui at a reported 50m euros (Anfield Watch via CaughtOffside) and Feyenoord's Givairo Read (TeamTalk), both January-shaped projects rather than September solutions. The injury this week came one layer down: Isaac Mabaya, a twenty-one-year-old right-back who plays for the Under-21s, withdrew from Zimbabwe's squad with a groin problem sustained in the Under-21s' win over Brighton on 19 September (This Is Anfield / Nehanda Radio)." },
    { position: "Centre-forward", level: "high", detail: "Four of Liverpool's seven league goals belong to one man, which is a strength and a single point of failure at once. Isak scored his fourth in five league games and Liverpool's other routes to a goal at the Vitality were a deflected Barcola shot and two Szoboszlai free-kicks. Koumas is the false-nine cover the cup used. Ekitike's Achilles keeps January as the earliest realistic return, so a single hamstring still separates this squad from a genuine crisis, and the international break is three weeks of that hamstring being used by Sweden, who got a twentieth-minute goal out of it against Romania on Friday. Chiesa resuming training in the fortnight is the one bit of relief in view." },
    { position: "Centre-back", level: "medium", detail: "The least pressing question on this board today, with a longer-dated one attached: Van Dijk has committed to the Netherlands through Euro 2028 while his Liverpool contract ends in 2027 (ESPN / This Is Anfield). Van Dijk and Jacquet kept a third consecutive clean sheet together and Jacquet took the highest rating on the field, which makes the first-choice pair the least pressing question on this board. Behind them Gomez is fit and stays at the AXA over the break, Araujo covers at a pinch, and Leoni is due to rejoin group training during the international window with Sports Mole pencilling mid-October. The dated caveat is unchanged: Endo, the emergency fifth centre-half, is listed for sale in January." },
    { position: "Left-back", level: "high", detail: "Unchanged, and the last game supplied evidence rather than relief. Milos Kerkez started against the club that sold him and the BBC's report is that he struggled initially and was regularly targeted with the crossfield ball over his head, with effort rather than quality the thing worth praising. Tsimikas was an unused substitute. Two senior options, neither of whom the reporting believes is at the manager's standard, no market until January, and Semenyo attacking that side on 11 October." },
    { position: "Wide forward", level: "medium", detail: "The department that won the last game, and the one whose most expensive occupant is being told in public to sit out the next. Gakpo, a fitness doubt until the warm-up, played the right rather than the left and created three chances, joint-most on the field per Opta; Barcola played the left and was largely contained. Munoz is the fourth option and away for none of the acclaim. Ngumoha is with England. Chiesa is due to resume training by the end of the month, which would make five wide forwards for two flanks by mid-October, though TEAMtalk and Sport Witness report he will be put on the January market at around 15m euros unless he breaks into the side." },
    { position: "Central midfield", level: "medium", detail: "Held at medium on availability. The contract stand-off moved in tone on Tuesday, Mac Allister telling reporters he was very sad not to be offered terms but that two more years would be perfect, and Sports Mole and Goal reported the club still wants Inter's Aleksandar Stankovic after a summer refusal. Mac Allister and Szoboszlai started together and the BBC's reading was that Mac Allister found space to open the game up after a slow start while Szoboszlai played with purpose, was booked after half-time, and put two free-kicks narrowly wide. Gravenberch came on for the last nine minutes, the clearest signal yet of the order. Endo, available all season as the emergency fifth centre-back, is listed for a January exit, and Mac Allister is running down a deal the club has not offered to extend." },

Six points from those four league games would be a good return and would hold the pace near 1.67 (fifteen from nine), a Europa-band season. Nine or more and the sixty-eight-point projection stops looking like an artefact of one afternoon at the Vitality. Three or fewer and the unbeaten start becomes the thing people remember rather than the thing that mattered. The genuine unknown is condition: most of this squad plays international football for three weeks and reassembles in the week of the hardest home fixture of the season.",
