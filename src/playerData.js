  summary:
    "MATCH DAY — April 14: Tonight is the night. Liverpool host PSG at Anfield (8pm BST) for the Champions League quarter-final second leg, trailing 2-0 from Paris and in need of an Anfield miracle. Slot has vowed his side will 'take risks' and 'have the ball more' — a clear departure from the cautious back-five approach that backfired in the first leg. Curtis Jones is out with a groin injury; Alisson, Endo, Bradley and Leoni remain sidelined, with Isak likely starting on the bench as his fitness builds. Off the pitch, David Ornstein reported today that FSG are 'steadfastly behind' Slot and planning four summer signings, even as Xabi Alonso links refuse to die down. Saturday's 2-0 win over Fulham — lit up by 17-year-old Rio Ngumoha breaking Sterling's Anfield record — restored some confidence heading into tonight.",
