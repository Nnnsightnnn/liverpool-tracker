  summary:
    "Heading into the weekend, the story dominating Anfield is Hugo Ekitike's ruptured Achilles — scans confirmed today that Liverpool's 18-goal top scorer will miss 9-12 months and is ruled out of the 2026 World Cup with France, a devastating blow compounding Tuesday's 0-2 home defeat to PSG (0-4 aggregate) that ended the Reds' Champions League campaign. Arne Slot is under mounting pressure after the UCL exit, telling reporters today that Liverpool 'need to sell before buying' this summer; conflicting reports swirl about FSG's stance, with Slot currently 2/1 to remain as manager at the start of 2026-27. With Ekitike gone and Salah departing, Liverpool's Salah-replacement hunt is accelerating — Michael Olise is the 'dream target', though a Bayern exit is considered near-impossible, while Brighton's Yankuba Minteh (~£66m) and Juventus winger Francisco Conceição are shortlisted as realistic alternatives. Attention now turns to Sunday's first-ever Merseyside Derby at Everton's new Hill Dickinson Stadium (April 19, 2pm BST), with Liverpool 5th in the PL and three points clear of Chelsea in the top-five race.",
