  overview:
    "Three days past the final whistle, the table is read less as a scoreboard than as a brief for the summer. The four automatic Champions League berths — Arsenal eighty-five, Manchester City seventy-eight, Manchester United seventy-one, Aston Villa sixty-five — and a Liverpool fifth on sixty separate the next-season squad-builds from the ones merely trimming around the edges. The European-football line sits between Brighton at eighth and Brentford at ninth: Bournemouth and a promoted Sunderland take Europa football, Brighton the Conference play-off, the Bees out of Europe for the first time in their history. Beneath, the bottom three — West Ham, Burnley and Wolves — sit at the end of a season that was decided long before the last weekend. The fact the title race was won without a domestic cup — Arsenal the first English champion since 2017 to manage it — is the kind of footnote that becomes a record in five years' time.",

Kennet Eichhorn, sixteen, the Hertha midfielder Liverpool reportedly wanted now, will not be allowed to register at Anfield until July 2027 — the post-Brexit ban on signing players under eighteen has closed the door. A pre-contract is still allowed; the cheque must wait a year. The club's plan, the reporting goes, was always a loan out anyway; the timetable, in the end, was the only thing that changed. Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern and PSG are circling the same delay.",

  summary:
    "Wednesday, May 27 — and the Eichhorn story has hit a wall the reporting did not anticipate twenty-four hours ago. Brexit, as Liverpool.com and Sportbible carry it this morning, blocks the move outright: English clubs cannot register a player under eighteen, and the sixteen-year-old Hertha midfielder cannot officially sign for Anfield until July 2027 when he turns of age. The club may agree a pre-contract; the actual transfer waits a year. While that file pauses, another opens: Fabrizio Romano gives the 'here we go' on Samuel Martinez, the seventeen-year-old Colombian attacking midfielder from Atletico Nacional — a five-year deal worth roughly a million dollars, signed now and triggered when he turns eighteen in 2027. In midfield this summer's headline target sharpens around Victor Froholdt, the Porto Danish international with a £73.5m release clause and Arsenal queueing alongside. The Salah-replacement domino has Yan Diomande's coyness pushing PSG's Bradley Barcola up the list. And the end-of-season review formally opens this week, with Anfield Index and Anfield Watch reporting Michael Edwards and Richard Hughes split on Slot's future — Iraola still kept warm in the wings.",

        "The morning's reversal of yesterday's lead: under post-Brexit Premier League regulations, English clubs cannot register players under eighteen, and Kennet Eichhorn — the sixteen-year-old Hertha Berlin defensive midfielder Liverpool had been in talks for — cannot officially sign at Anfield until July 2027. Liverpool can agree a pre-contract this summer with a one- or two-year loan baked into the plan, but the transfer itself is a year away. Real Madrid, Barcelona, PSG, Bayern, Arsenal and Manchester United have all been linked.",

Romano calls it 'here we go' on Samuel Martinez, the seventeen-year-old attacking midfielder from Atletico Nacional — a five-year deal at a fee of around one million dollars, with the move triggered when he turns eighteen. Atletico negotiated a sell-on clause. Borussia Dortmund and Barcelona were outbid. The Colombian U-17 South American Championship winner is being branded, optimistically, 'the next Kaká.'",

Damien Comolli's opening offer from Juventus came in at €5m against a Liverpool asking price of €20m; Mamardashvili, signed for £29m last summer, may now go out on loan.

A £35m switch is mooted; Inter have warned Jones's representatives they will not pay above their valuation, but Liverpool's shelved contract talks are seen by Milan as helpful leverage. Liverpool insist they are not actively pushing the Anfield-born midfielder out of the door, even as they decline to extend him.
