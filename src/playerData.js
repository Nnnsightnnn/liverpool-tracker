// TWO-TRACK PIPELINE (see docs/COVER-IMAGE-PIPELINE.md):

  // wide, Nyoni and Mac Allister screening, Isak/Van Dijk/Szoboszlai/Wirtz rested), with Andy Robertson's first return to
  // Anfield in Tottenham colours the night's sub-plot. No new image queued under STEP 7.5 (a pre-match preview is not a
  // single still); Antigravity may generate a post-match hero image tonight if the tie produces one. Table unchanged from
  // ESPN, Liverpool eighth. All eight generatedAt stamps 08:30Z.
  // Evening pass (Mon 14 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): no match since Saturday, so the Jacquet plate is carried and
  // generatedAt re-stamped only. The `focus` line and `brief` below still describe the Fulham clearance, which is now the
  // third story on the page. The lead rotated to Iraola's Monday press conference at the AXA: Mamardashvili confirmed to
  // start (a first appearance of the season, the manager volunteering that he tried to sign him for Bournemouth), Gomez
  // upgraded from doubt to 'available for tomorrow', and the manager's own account of a schedule he called the worst
  // scenario. A press conference has no single still photograph in it, so NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5 and the
  // brief below is intentionally left at the last genuinely photographable moment; Antigravity should treat it as served.
  // Also this pass: Tottenham's team news reversed the weekend's reading (Tonali out with a knock, Porro and Kulusevski
  // out, Richarlison excluded from the squad entirely, Udogie back, Van de Ven in fact fit and a starter at Everton), and
  // the table moved without Liverpool playing, Leeds beating Newcastle 4-1 at Elland Road to go third and Liverpool
  // slipping from seventh to eighth on the same six points.
  // Machine-readable handoff written by the daily run, consumed by Antigravity.
  // Evening pass (Sat 12 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): a match was played. Liverpool 0-0 Fulham at Anfield,
  // the first blank under Iraola and a fourth straight Anfield league draw, the first such run since November
  // 2011 per Opta. Jacquet cleared Garcia's shot off the line on 12 after Alisson's short pass to a marked
  // Gravenberch (King's penalty appeal waved away); Munoz headed a corner against the bar on 22; Leno saved
  // from Isak and Mac Allister; Alisson tipped King's curler wide on 76; Muniz missed on 79. Opta: 1.13 xG from
  // 14 shots to 0.71 from 10. Three changes (Tsimikas, Gravenberch, Munoz) all withdrawn by the hour; Gakpo back
  // from the bench; Gomez not in the squad. Iraola: 'a lack of freshness, definitely, we cannot hide it'.
  // The result leads every surface. Next: Tottenham, Carabao Cup third round, Anfield, Tuesday 8pm, ITV and
  // Sky; NEXT_MATCH rolled forward and the OPPOSITION dossier rebuilt for De Zerbi's goalless side. A goal-line
  // clearance IS a photographable moment under STEP 7.5, so a Track 1 plate was generated (the clearance, no
  // text) and the Track 2 brief below is the open request for Antigravity (COVER-00001). The limn-editor-enhance
  // skill was not present on this mount, so the request is recorded here and in cover-brief.json only.
  // Morning pass (Sat 12 September): MATCHDAY. Fulham at Anfield today at 3pm; no match or ruling-out
  // since Wednesday's Atletico win, table byte-identical from ESPN. Lead rotated off Friday evening's
  // Ekitike-January anchor onto the fixture itself; Gakpo the lone doubt into matchday, Barcola and Kerkez
  // cleared, Gomez in line for a first bench. Mac Allister strike plate carried and re-stamped.
  // Morning pass (Sun 13 September, ~4am ET): no match since Saturday; table byte-identical from ESPN (the
  // Manchester derby is this afternoon, unplayed). Lead rotated off the Fulham result onto the Sunday-morning
  // reckoning on Iraola: 'officially under serious pressure' (AnfieldWatch/LiveScore/Yahoo) after one win in
  // four, with no sporting director (Hughes long gone to Al-Hilal, Gordon/FSG hunting a fifth since 2022), his
  // fuller 'what was lacking was quite clear' post-mortem, and Pablo Barrios (Atletico) the one new January/
  // summer midfield thread. NOT a sacking; contradiction sweep clean. A manager-pressure lead is not
  // photographable, so no new image queued; Jacquet clearance plate carried and generatedAt re-stamped.
  // Evening pass (Sun 13 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): no match since Saturday, so the Jacquet plate is carried
  // and generatedAt re-stamped only. NOTE: the `focus` line above and the `brief` below still describe the Fulham
  // clearance, which is now the SECOND story on the page, not the lead. The lead rotated to the captain's contract:
  // Liverpool will not open Van Dijk talks until 2027, no decision before April, the deal expiring that summer
  // (Football Insider, carried by Yahoo / CaughtOffside / Sports Mole). A contract that is deliberately not being
  // discussed has no single still photograph in it, so NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5 and the brief below
  // is intentionally left at the last genuinely photographable moment. Antigravity should treat it as already served.
  // The table moved without Liverpool playing: City won the derby with ten men, Brighton won 5-0 at Coventry,
  // Liverpool slip to seventh on the same six points.
  // Evening pass (Fri 11 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): no match since Wednesday. The lead moved to the one
  // new fact from Friday's briefing: Iraola put a January date, of sorts, on Ekitike's Achilles. Plate carried.
  // Evening pass (Wed 9 September): a match was played. Liverpool 2-1 Atletico Madrid at Anfield, the Champions
  // League opener: Llorente 17, Szoboszlai 40, Mac Allister 50. Opta: 1.68 xG from 14 shots to 0.81 from 9.
  // Track 1 plate 2026-09-09-mac-allister-strike.svg.
  // Evening pass (Sat 5 September): Richard Hughes stepped down as sporting director. Track 1 plate 2026-09-05-hughes-exit.svg.

  summary:
    "Thursday evening, and the first full session after the international break has sharpened Sunday's question: Alexander Isak and Cody Gakpo both missed training at the AXA, and the Liverpool Echo's Paul Gorst calls them major doubts for Manchester City's visit, while Jeremy Jacquet trained after his hamstring strain (CaughtOffside, Yahoo Sports) and Federico Chiesa was back with the group for the first time this season (Liverpool Echo via RotoWire).

  summary:
    "Manchester City spent Thursday getting players back while Liverpool were losing them: Haaland, substituted for Norway in what was called fatigue, and Semenyo, who left Ghana's squad with a swollen leg, both returned to team training (DaveOCKOP). Maresca, speaking to the club's own media, called the feeling in the camp fantastic and said the players know the noise is there but 'don't care too much about' it (via 101 Great Goals), nine days after an independent commission found City guilty of using sham commercial contracts and with the appeal under way, sanctions that Al Jazeera says could run from a severe points penalty to expulsion. They lead on fifteen from five and are unbeaten in ten away league games (Liverpool FC), though Arsenal can draw level by beating Leeds on Saturday, and Paris Saint-Germain visit the Etihad on Wednesday. Foden serves the last game of his ban, O'Reilly and Doku remain doubts, and Sky Sports' Lewis Jones and Squawka's model both make City favourites at Anfield.",
  shape:
    "Maresca has kept the possession spine and loosened everything in front of it, which is why City look like a scoring machine and a defensive argument at the same time. The back four sits high with Gvardiol at left-back stepping into midfield and Matheus Nunes giving width on the right; Enzo Fernandez and Elliot Anderson screen in a double pivot that is more about ball progression than protection. Rayan Cherki plays between the lines and carries, with Antoine Semenyo and Iliman Ndiaye on the flanks and Haaland pinning the centre-backs. The pattern that beat Sunderland twice over and nearly cost them the afternoon is the same one: when the ball turns over in City's half, the space between that high line and Donnarumma is enormous, and Sunderland needed very little invitation to run into it three times on 20 September.",

Liverpool's problem this season has been converting what they create rather than creating it: seven goals from 7.57 expected across the first five league games, per Opta. A goalkeeper in this form behind a defence that shipped three last time out, on 20 September, is the matchup the City game turns on.",

  liverpoolAngle:
    "Thursday's training shifted the matchup in one direction. Liverpool's back four is probably whole again, with Jacquet in group drills (CaughtOffside), but the attack that was meant to punish City's high line has lost, for now, its two most productive players: Isak, second in the league for expected goals at 3.5 (Liverpool FC), and Gakpo both missed the session and are major doubts (Liverpool Echo). City complete 83 per cent of passes under high-intensity pressure, the best in the league, against a Liverpool press that leads it at 48.9 per cent of opposition-half touches (Liverpool FC), so the forwards' first job is defensive. Koumas offers the run in behind that hurt City when Sunderland scored three at the Etihad on 20 September; a Wirtz false nine, TEAMtalk's alternative, offers an extra passer but less threat behind. At the other end Haaland and Semenyo are both back in training (DaveOCKOP), and Liverpool's nine fast-break goals conceded since the start of last season, the most in the league (Opta), are the vulnerability City are built to exploit.",

Seven goals from 7.57 expected is a side scoring roughly what it makes, and four of those seven belong to Isak, against three in fourteen Premier League appearances across the whole of last season. The concentration is the pattern, not the total. The number-ten position behind him has produced no league goal and no league assist in six competitive games, and Opta's Bournemouth card is the clearest illustration: Florian Wirtz created a joint-game-high three chances and returned a team-low 70.3 per cent passing accuracy from twenty-six of thirty-seven passes, with sixteen possessions lost.
