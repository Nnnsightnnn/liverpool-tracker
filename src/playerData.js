Morgan Rogers, a curling 43rd-minute opener; Ollie Watkins, twice, the 57th and the 73rd; John McGinn, from outside the box, the fourth. Three of the four arrived from set-pieces. Slot, post-match: 'we conceded far too many goals.' Van Dijk's 52nd-minute equaliser, off a Szoboszlai free-kick, was the only spell of the night when the Anfield away end could believe. By the final whistle Villa were fourth, certified, and Liverpool were fifth on the same 65 points, only goal-difference and the calendar separating the Reds from a Bournemouth and a Chelsea who play this weekend.

  summary:
    "Saturday morning after the night before — Aston Villa 4-2 Liverpool at Villa Park ripped a Champions League place out of Slot's hands and dropped the Reds from 4th to 5th in the Premier League table (ESPN / Sky Sports / NBC Sports). Ollie Watkins scored a brace (57', 73'), Morgan Rogers opened the scoring with a curling 43' finish from a Digne short-corner routine, and John McGinn lashed in a fourth from outside the box; Virgil van Dijk's TWO headers (52' equaliser off a Szoboszlai free-kick, and a 90+ consolation) were Liverpool's only reply in a wretched team performance. Slot in the post-match presser called it 'damaging' and conceded the central failing: 'three out of four from set pieces' — Liverpool's set-piece haemorrhage from the season writ large. With Villa now on 68 pts and Liverpool on 65, the Reds must beat Brentford at Anfield next Sunday May 24 to guarantee top five; a Bournemouth or Chelsea stumble across the weekend would also help. Off-pitch the pressure on Slot ratchets up (Murphy on Sky: 'his time is up'; Carragher: 'showing signs of buckling') even as the manager again insisted 'I have every reason to believe I am the Liverpool manager next season.' Salah came off the bench for a cameo in his first action since April 25, with the Anfield farewell vs Brentford now both a tribute night AND a must-win.",
