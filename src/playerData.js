// TWO-TRACK PIPELINE (see docs/COVER-IMAGE-PIPELINE.md):

//   • Antigravity ("agy") reads `brief`, generates a premium photographic image
//     when the lead is genuinely visual, drops the JPG in public/assets/cover/,
//     and repoints `src` + `credit` + `generatedAt` at it.

  // first time this season Liverpool have scored three. NO expected-goals figures had been published at the

  // Anfield in Tottenham colours the night's sub-plot. No new image queued under STEP 7.5 (a pre-match preview is not a

  // Evening pass (Mon 14 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): no match since Saturday, so the Jacquet plate is carried and
  // generatedAt re-stamped only. The `focus` line and `brief` below still describe the Fulham clearance, which is now the
  // third story on the page. The lead rotated to Iraola's Monday press conference at the AXA: Mamardashvili confirmed to
  // start (a first appearance of the season, the manager volunteering that he tried to sign him for Bournemouth), Gomez
  // upgraded from doubt to 'available for tomorrow', and the manager's own account of a schedule he called the worst
  // scenario. A press conference has no single still photograph in it, so NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5 and the
  // brief below is intentionally left at the last genuinely photographable moment; Antigravity should treat it as served.
  // Also this pass: Tottenham's team news reversed the weekend's reading (Tonali out with a knock, Porro and Kulusevski
  // out, Richarlison excluded from the squad entirely, Udogie back, Van de Ven in fact fit and a starter at Everton), and
  // the table moved without Liverpool playing, Leeds beating Newcastle 4-1 at Elland Road to go third and Liverpool
  // slipping from seventh to eighth on the same six points.
  // Machine-readable handoff written by the daily run, consumed by Antigravity.
  // Evening pass (Sat 12 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): a match was played. Liverpool 0-0 Fulham at Anfield,
  // the first blank under Iraola and a fourth straight Anfield league draw, the first such run since November
  // 2011 per Opta. Jacquet cleared Garcia's shot off the line on 12 after Alisson's short pass to a marked
  // Gravenberch (King's penalty appeal waved away); Munoz headed a corner against the bar on 22; Leno saved
  // from Isak and Mac Allister; Alisson tipped King's curler wide on 76; Muniz missed on 79. Opta: 1.13 xG from
  // 14 shots to 0.71 from 10. Three changes (Tsimikas, Gravenberch, Munoz) all withdrawn by the hour; Gakpo back
  // from the bench; Gomez not in the squad. Iraola: 'a lack of freshness, definitely, we cannot hide it'.
  // The result leads every surface. Next: Tottenham, Carabao Cup third round, Anfield, Tuesday 8pm, ITV and
  // Sky; NEXT_MATCH rolled forward and the OPPOSITION dossier rebuilt for De Zerbi's goalless side. A goal-line
  // clearance IS a photographable moment under STEP 7.5, so a Track 1 plate was generated (the clearance, no

  // cleared, Gomez in line for a first bench. Mac Allister strike plate carried and re-stamped.
  // Morning pass (Sun 13 September, ~4am ET): no match since Saturday; table byte-identical from ESPN (the
  // Manchester derby is this afternoon, unplayed). Lead rotated off the Fulham result onto the Sunday-morning
  // reckoning on Iraola: 'officially under serious pressure' (AnfieldWatch/LiveScore/Yahoo) after one win in
  // four, with no sporting director (Hughes long gone to Al-Hilal, Gordon/FSG hunting a fifth since 2022), his
  // fuller 'what was lacking was quite clear' post-mortem, and Pablo Barrios (Atletico) the one new January/
  // summer midfield thread. NOT a sacking; contradiction sweep clean. A manager-pressure lead is not
  // photographable, so no new image queued; Jacquet clearance plate carried and generatedAt re-stamped.
  // Evening pass (Sun 13 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): no match since Saturday, so the Jacquet plate is carried
  // and generatedAt re-stamped only. NOTE: the `focus` line above and the `brief` below still describe the Fulham
  // clearance, which is now the SECOND story on the page, not the lead. The lead rotated to the captain's contract:
  // Liverpool will not open Van Dijk talks until 2027, no decision before April, the deal expiring that summer
  // (Football Insider, carried by Yahoo / CaughtOffside / Sports Mole). A contract that is deliberately not being
  // discussed has no single still photograph in it, so NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5 and the brief below
  // is intentionally left at the last genuinely photographable moment. Antigravity should treat it as already served.
  // The table moved without Liverpool playing: City won the derby with ten men, Brighton won 5-0 at Coventry,
  // Liverpool slip to seventh on the same six points.
  // Evening pass (Fri 11 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): no match since Wednesday. The lead moved to the one

  summary:
    "City's Friday night in Saint-Denis was split down the middle: Rayan Cherki's free-kick, flicked on and deflected, made Michael Olise's goal for France, and Gianluigi Donnarumma made a double save from Doue and Dembele to keep Italy level at 1-1 (Football Italia), with Liverpool's Jacquet on the pitch throughout. Erling Haaland's window has so far been a quiet night in Cardiff in Norway's 2-1 defeat by Wales. City are first on fifteen, five from five in Enzo Maresca's first season after Pep Guardiola, though Opta's expected-points model, via Read Man City, puts them second behind Arsenal, and the verdict on the 115 charges, with Keith Wyness's talk of escape clauses for Maresca, is still the backdrop (Football Insider via Football365). Their Anfield list now has Nico O'Reilly withdrawn from England's squad on top of Phil Foden's last game of a ban and Antoine Semenyo's swollen leg, and Sunderland's three goals at the Etihad remain the best evidence that this City concede.",
  shape:
    "Maresca has kept the possession spine and loosened everything in front of it, which is why City look like a scoring machine and a defensive argument at the same time. The back four sits high with Gvardiol at left-back stepping into midfield and Matheus Nunes giving width on the right; Enzo Fernandez and Elliot Anderson screen in a double pivot that is more about ball progression than protection. Rayan Cherki plays between the lines and carries, with Antoine Semenyo and Iliman Ndiaye on the flanks and Haaland pinning the centre-backs. The pattern that beat Sunderland twice over and nearly cost them the afternoon is the same one: when the ball turns over in City's half, the space between that high line and Donnarumma is enormous, and Sunderland needed very little invitation to run into it three times on 20 September.",

Against Liverpool he has three goals in six meetings, one of his leaner records, but the division's leading scorer arriving at a back line with three straight clean sheets is still the clearest question of the fixture.",

At club level he conceded three at home to Sunderland on 20 September, the only blemish on a five-win start and the reason City's goal difference is plus eight rather than something more intimidating. Liverpool's problem this season has been converting what they create rather than creating it: seven goals from 7.57 expected across the first five league games, per Opta. A goalkeeper in this form behind a defence that has just shipped three is the matchup the City game turns on.",

  liverpoolAngle:
    "Friday night previewed one half of the duel and blurred the other. Jacquet, Van Dijk's partner on three straight league clean sheets, played ninety minutes in a France side built around Cherki, the City player who works the seam he will be asked to close (Football Italia, Liverpool FC); Barcola, the left of Liverpool's attack on this sheet, came off the bench rather than starting and met Donnarumma in his best form of the window. The frame is still the club's Opta review: Liverpool rank first for high pressures in the opponent's half (Liverpool FC), and City build through a high line and a double pivot, so if the press wins the ball where Sunderland did, the space behind Gvardiol and Nunes is the prize. The counterpart is Liverpool's own weakness: nine fast-break goals conceded since the start of last season, the most in the league (Opta), on a right flank where Araujo, a centre-half, has started five straight league games, and Semenyo's swollen leg decides how hard that side is tested. Kerkez, on the other flank, comes home with a goal and, thanks to a suspension, a game fewer in his legs.",

The Athletic reports, relayed by CaughtOffside, that Leoni is expected back later this month, a year on from the ACL rupture on his debut, and that staff believe he 'used the time wisely to understand more about Liverpool and improve his English'. Iraola had set out the plan before the break: 'The next one probably should be Giovanni Leoni. I think the plan is also to start training during the break, with the group.' The club has not confirmed that he has.

AnfieldWatch, in LiveScore's round-up, reports Inter considering a January move and the player open to going home.

Gomez is back in full training after the hamstring problem that cost him a month, a fourth senior centre-back and a specialist right-back, alongside Frimpong, in one body, and his next appearance in any competition will be his three hundredth for the club.

It follows a goalless draw with Ukraine and a ninety-ninth-minute defeat by Northern Ireland.

Yahoo Sports describes a stamp on the foot that left a bloodied toe after ninety minutes against Romania; Sweden's coach spoke of a small thigh problem; the club calls it minor and City on 11 October the target.

Endo is among the senior group Iraola keeps through the break, and Liverpool closed out the Bournemouth lead without ever calling on an extra holding midfielder. The reporting stands: FSG will sanction a January exit, the last window in which a fee is recoverable on a 2027 contract, with Ben Jacobs's line that 'Iraola clearly doesn't fancy him'.

It also gave him a booking for a tactical foul on seventy-four, his second of the competition after the shoving match against Ukraine, so he misses the return game in Trnava on Monday.

  depthRisk: [
    { position: "Right-back", level: "high", detail: "Still the department with no answer inside the building, though its incumbent came through Monday in good order: Araujo played ninety minutes of Uruguay's 4-1 win in Seoul, booked, eleven defensive contributions (Rush The Kop). Ronald Araujo, a centre-half by trade, has started five consecutive league games at right-back and the BBC's verdict at Bournemouth was that he defends the position comfortably but offers little going forward, the accurate summary of a working compromise. The department does not get deeper for three months: Conor Bradley's knee has no club date and FotMob's listing pushes him to early January 2027, Frimpong, cut from the Dutch 23 for Serbia, is the cup alternative, and Gomez, the other specialist alongside him, stays at the AXA through the break. Manchester City attack that flank with Antoine Semenyo, who withdrew from Ghana's window with a swollen leg and is a minor doubt (Sports Mole). The movement this week was reportorial and doubled: Liverpool are linked with Benfica's eighteen-year-old Daniel Banjaqui at a reported 50m euros (Anfield Watch via CaughtOffside) and Feyenoord's Givairo Read (TeamTalk), both January-shaped projects rather than September solutions. The injury this week came one layer down: Isaac Mabaya, a twenty-one-year-old right-back who plays for the Under-21s, withdrew from Zimbabwe's squad with a groin problem sustained in the Under-21s' win over Brighton on 19 September (This Is Anfield / Nehanda Radio)." },
    { position: "Centre-forward", level: "critical", detail: "Still critical, and Friday evening brought no bulletin to change that. The better news is older: Lewis Koumas started at nine for Wales in a 2-1 win over Norway on Thursday and drew a 7/10 from Y Clwb Pel-droed, and L'Equipe, via CaughtOffside, reports Ekitike targeting team training in November and matchday squads in December, unconfirmed by the club. Neither changes City: Isak, scorer of four of seven league goals, has had no bulletin on the foot and thigh the club calls minor, Gakpo, the first cover at nine, is reported out for several weeks, and Chiesa has not played since August. If Isak is not right, Koumas makes a full league debut against the leaders, or Munoz is tried centrally, as Rousing The Kop suggests. No market until January." },
    { position: "Centre-back", level: "medium", detail: "Healthy, and Friday added two things. Jacquet played all ninety minutes of France's 1-1 with Italy, a second cap four days after his first (Liverpool FC, Rush The Kop), and The Athletic, via CaughtOffside, expects Leoni back later this month, the first credible date for a fifth senior centre-back. Van Dijk headed a goal on his 99th cap in Thessaloniki on Thursday and came through unhurt (AP). He and Jacquet have kept three consecutive league clean sheets, and the club's Opta review has Jacquet at 76.9 per cent in aerial duels. The longer question is the captain's contract, which ends in summer 2027 with no renewal offered: Real Madrid weighing a free transfer (Mundo Deportivo via Goal), Galatasaray said to be ready to approach in January and Bastoni, who scored for Italy on Friday, tracked as a successor (AnfieldWatch via LiveScore). Behind the pair, Gomez is fit, Araujo covers and Endo, the emergency fifth, is listed for January." },
    { position: "Left-back", level: "high", detail: "Unchanged in level, improved in mood. Kerkez headed his first Hungary goal past Mamardashvili on Friday, then took a booking that suspends him for Monday's game against Ukraine (Liverpool FC, Origo), so he returns to City week with a game fewer in his legs. Tsimikas plays Germany, and Wirtz, on Sunday. The last club game is still the evidence: Kerkez started against the club that sold him and the BBC's report says he struggled initially and was targeted over the top, praised for effort rather than quality. Two senior options, neither of whom the reporting rates at the manager's standard, no market until January, and Semenyo attacking that side on 11 October if his leg clears." },
    { position: "Wide forward", level: "critical", detail: "Critical since Monday, and Friday did not settle the left: Barcola came off the bench in France's 1-1 with Italy rather than starting, which Rush The Kop read as a sign he is not yet in Zidane's first eleven. Gakpo's ankle, reported as several weeks, takes out the player who started on the right at Bournemouth and created three chances, and leaves Barcola, Munoz and Ngumoha to cover two flanks against City, LASK and Brentford. Ngumoha stays in England's squad after Nico O'Reilly's withdrawal (Yahoo Sports), and Munoz came off the bench in Spain's 4-1 win over Croatia (Liverpool FC), so both deputies have international minutes. Chiesa's end-of-month target for group training lapsed without confirmation, Inter are reported to be weighing January (AnfieldWatch via LiveScore), and he is still the only reinforcement in sight. TEAMtalk's Mitoma report is a January thought, not a City one." },
    { position: "Central midfield", level: "medium", detail: "Medium on availability. Szoboszlai captained Hungary for eighty minutes of Friday's 1-0 win over Georgia, replaced by Szucs (Yahoo Sports), and has Ukraine on Monday (Liverpool FC); Gravenberch came on at half-time in Thessaloniki on Thursday and has not started any of Liverpool's last three league games, with AnfieldWatch asking whether he suits anything but a midfield three (via LiveScore). Mac Allister and Szoboszlai are the pivot; Mac Allister, with Argentina until 6 October, is running down a deal TEAMtalk reports the club is cooling on extending, and Sports Mole and Goal report interest in Inter's Aleksandar Stankovic, with Bournemouth said to have rebuffed enquiries for Alex Scott (AnfieldWatch via LiveScore). Endo is listed for January and Nyoni, nineteen and just promoted to England's Under-21s, is the other cover." },
