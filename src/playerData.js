  // Van Dijk, deal to summer 2027, no renewal offered. Also: Rummenigge on Wirtz ('I don't know'); Gakpo still ungraded,
  // CaughtOffside's three-week reading (City, LASK out; Brentford earliest); Isak's injury reported as a stamp and bloodied
  // toe (Yahoo Sports); Jacquet's line-breaking numbers (Empire of the Kop). NO new image queued. All 8 generatedAt 22:30Z.
  // Morning pass (Tue 29 September, ~4am ET): NO MATCH, international break. The lead moves from Monday's confirmation to
  // Tuesday's scan: Gakpo's ankle has gone for imaging with no club grade, the range spanning a fortnight for a mild sprain
  // (Sports Mole) to a possible high ankle sprain and surgery, eight to ten weeks (Physio Scout via CaughtOffside), with
  // Rik Elfrink's several weeks from the Eindhoven examination in between; City on 11 October beyond him either way. Also:
  // the attack-without-Gakpo previews sharpen (GiveMeSport expects Ngumoha unleashed on the right; AnfieldWatch has Koumas
  // ready for a first league start). No Tuesday internationals for LFC players. NO new image queued (a scan is not a still).
  // Plate carried, all 8 generatedAt 08:30Z.
  // Evening pass (Mon 28 September, ~6pm ET): NO MATCH, international break. The lead moves from scan day to its answer:
  // Liverpool confirmed Gakpo has withdrawn from the Netherlands squad (ankle, Serbia 27 Sep) and returns to the AXA for
  // assessment; Dutch journalist Rik Elfrink reports several weeks out (Inside Futbol, Yahoo Sports), likely including City
  // on 11 October. Also: Jacquet's first France cap and a clean sheet in Brussels; Monday's other internationals came through.
  // NO new image queued (a withdrawal is not a still). Plate carried, all 8 generatedAt 22:30Z.
  // Evening pass (Sun 27 September, ~6pm ET): NO MATCH, international break. The lead is injury news for the City week:
  // Isak sent home from Sweden (club: minor injury; Potter: minor thigh problem) and Gakpo forced off after 17 minutes of
  // Serbia 1-2 Netherlands with a left-ankle injury, scan Monday (Goal, Liverpool.com). Also: Liverpool Women 2-0 Everton at

  // home game); Julian Ward's confirmation as sporting director (Sat) added, previously missed. NO new image queued.
  // Morning pass (Sun 27 September, ~4am ET): NO MATCH, international break. The lead rotates off Saturday evening's Wembley
  // frame onto September's Premier League award shortlists: Iraola up for Manager of the Month (his first as head coach), Isak
  // and Jacquet among the eight for Player of the Month, Alisson for Save of the Month (Liverpool FC, Yahoo Sports), off an
  // unbeaten September with three straight clean sheets, first since Sept 2024 (AllFootball). Sunday slate: four Reds with the

  // Isak's vote. NO new image queued (an award shortlist is not a Liverpool still). Plate carried, all 8 generatedAt 08:30Z.
  // Evening pass (Sat 26 September, ~6pm ET): NO MATCH, international break. The lead rotates off the morning's City-verdict
  // frame onto Wembley: Ngumoha and Munoz, billed as opponents, were both cut from the England and Spain matchday squads under
  // UEFA's 23-man cap (Sports Mole, Liverpool.com); Spain won 3-2 with City's Guehi and O'Reilly at fault (Sky Sports).
  // CORRECTION: the morning called it an Under-20 fixture; it was the senior Nations League game. Also fresh: Khaldoon's

  // Morning pass (Sat 26 September, ~4am ET): NO MATCH, international break. The lead rotates off Friday's Isak-in-Sweden
  // frame onto the story that broke overnight: multiple outlets (CNN, Yahoo Sports, CBS) report an independent commission has
  // found Manchester City guilty of 114 of 115 Premier League financial charges (2009-2018), no sanction set, appeal to come,
  // table untouched. City are Liverpool's next opponents (Anfield, 11 October) and title pace-setters; ex-captain Andy Robertson

  // Evening pass (Fri 25 September, ~6pm ET): NO MATCH, international break. The lead rotates off the morning's
  // Amsterdam fallout onto Friday night's internationals: Isak's 20th-minute opener in Sweden 2-1 Romania, in the week he and

  // Morning pass (Fri 25 September, ~4am ET): NO MATCH, international break. The lead rotates off Thursday's internationals
  // preview onto the fallout: Gakpo's stoppage-time volley (90+2) rescued Netherlands 1-1 Germany and denied Klopp a
  // winning debut, Van Dijk called Germany's goal-while-Brobbey-down a 'disgrace', Klopp answered 'no guilty conscience',
  // Kimmich backed Klopp. New: Iraola nominated Sept Manager of the Month (with Maresca, Hurzeler); Klopp held Wirtz out

  // appointment 'a lot of sense', with Sky's Lyall Thomas naming Brentford's Lee Dykes as a possible partner. Reported,

  // Evening pass (Tue 22 September, 6pm ET): NO MATCH, international break. The lead rotates to The Athletic's
  // report that Julian Ward is set to return as sporting director (reported, not announced), with Mac Allister's
  // fuller 'very sad'/'that's perfect' interview, Van Dijk's Netherlands commitment to Euro 2028, Foden's ban
  // running out at Anfield and the U21s' 7-6 shootout win at Rochdale behind it. NO new image queued under

  // re-stamped, cover-brief.json re-mirrored. All eight generatedAt stamps 22:30Z.
  // Morning pass (Tue 22 September, ~4am ET): NO MATCH, international break. The lead is the Florian Wirtz row:
  // Andoni Iraola defending him to Sky Sports ('much happier with his second half than his first') and calling
  // Klopp's split-squad decision 'very smart', with Wirtz answering the criticism on Instagram ('Into the
  // international break with a win'). Second surface is the right-back file gaining two fresh January-shaped names,
  // Benfica's Banjaqui (50m euros) and Feyenoord's Read. NO new image queued under STEP 7.5: a social-media reply

  // re-stamped, cover-brief.json re-mirrored to this morning's lead. All eight generatedAt stamps 08:30Z.
  // Evening pass (Mon 21 September, 6pm ET): NO MATCH, international break. The lead is Alexis Mac Allister
  // telling ESPN there is "no firm decision" on a Liverpool contract the club has declined to open talks about,
  // with Jamie Carragher's call to drop Florian Wirtz for Manchester City the evening's second surface. Both are
  // interviews. NO new image queued under STEP 7.5: neither a contract stand-off nor a podcast verdict resolves
  // into a single still, and the skill caps queueing at one genuinely visual moment per edition. The standing
  // candidate for a future plate remains Jeremy Jacquet. Szoboszlai plate carried, generatedAt re-stamped only.
  // Previous evening pass (Sun 20 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): MATCH PLAYED. Bournemouth 0-1 Liverpool at the Vitality,
  // Isak turning in a blocked Gakpo cross on 57 for a third consecutive Premier League clean sheet, a rise from
  // tenth to sixth, and Iraola the first Liverpool manager unbeaten in his opening five league games since Joe
  // Fagan in 1983 (Opta). The Szoboszlai plate is carried one more edition and generatedAt re-stamped only.
  // NO new image queued under STEP 7.5: the goal was a six-yard tap-in from a deflected block, which is decisive
  // without being a single photographable still, and the skill caps queueing at one genuinely visual moment per
  // edition. If Antigravity wants a plate for the next edition, the candidate is Jacquet, twenty-one, taking the
  // highest rating on the field on the afternoon France called him up. STANDINGS rebuilt from ESPN (Liverpool
  // sixth on nine). OPPOSITION rebuilt from scratch for Manchester City at Anfield, 11 October. All eight
  // generatedAt stamps 22:30Z.
  // Morning pass (Sun 20 September, ~4am ET): MATCHDAY. Bournemouth away at 2pm at the Vitality, unplayed at the time of
  // writing, so the Szoboszlai plate is carried and generatedAt re-stamped only. The lead rotated off Saturday's table
  // movement onto the game itself: Iraola's first return to the club he managed for three years, the game in hand finally
  // paid, and the one live team-news question being Cody Gakpo's adductor doubt ('I cannot guarantee it', per This Is
  // Anfield). A matchday preview is not a single photographable still, so NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5;
  // Antigravity may generate a post-match hero image later if the game produces one. Table byte-identical from ESPN,
  // Liverpool tenth. All eight generatedAt stamps 08:30Z.
  // Evening pass (Sat 19 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): still no Liverpool match since Tuesday's cup tie, so the
  // Szoboszlai plate is carried and generatedAt re-stamped only. The lead rotated off the morning's homecoming-eve
  // preview onto Saturday's five Premier League results, which dropped Liverpool from eighth to tenth without them
  // playing: Brighton 3-0 Arsenal ended the champions' perfect start, Everton and Newcastle won, Coventry took a
  // first points and first goal at Forest, and Tottenham scored for the first time and lost 3-2 to Villa anyway.
  // The club also confirmed Chelsea at Anfield in the Carabao Cup fourth round on 28 October and the Champions
  // League trip to LASK on 14 October. A league table rearranging itself is not a single photographable still, so
  // NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5. All eight generatedAt stamps 22:30Z.
  // Morning pass (Sat 19 September, ~4am ET): no match since Tuesday's cup tie and the international break now open, so
  // the Szoboszlai volley plate is carried and generatedAt re-stamped only. The lead rotated off Friday evening's Ngumoha
  // call-up onto the eve of Sunday's fixture: Iraola's homecoming to Bournemouth, team news locked and the predicted league
  // XI settled, the last soft game before City, Brentford, Brighton and Arsenal. A matchday-eve build-up is not a single
  // photographable still, so NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5. Table byte-identical from ESPN, Liverpool eighth. All
  // eight generatedAt stamps 08:30Z.
  // Evening pass (Fri 18 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): no match since Tuesday's cup tie, so the Szoboszlai plate is
  // carried and generatedAt re-stamped only. The lead rotated off the morning's homecoming preview onto Rio Ngumoha's
  // call-up to Thomas Tuchel's England squad, announced Friday morning, plus Iraola's 1.30pm press conference. A squad
  // list read out in London is not a single photographable still, so NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5.
  // Morning pass (Fri 18 September, ~4am ET): no match since Tuesday's cup tie, so the Szoboszlai volley plate is
  // carried and generatedAt re-stamped only. The lead rotated off Thursday's Endo sale onto Sunday: Iraola's homecoming
  // to Bournemouth, previewed on the day of his 1.30pm press conference and the last fixture before the international

  // NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5. Table byte-identical from ESPN, Liverpool eighth. All eight generatedAt stamps 08:30Z.
  // Evening pass (Thu 17 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): no match since Tuesday's cup tie, so the Szoboszlai
  // volley plate is carried and generatedAt re-stamped only. The lead rotated off the cup draw onto Thursday's
  // squad decision: Liverpool have put Wataru Endo up for sale for January, six competitive games into Iraola's
  // first season, with Ben Jacobs the source under CaughtOffside, Football365, TeamTalk, SportBible and
  // Sportskeeda; the counterweight is the push to tie Rio Ngumoha to a new long-term deal inside a month.
  // A transfer-list decision and a contract negotiation are not single photographable stills, so NO new image
  // was queued under STEP 7.5. All eight generatedAt stamps 22:30Z.
  // Evening/overnight pass (started Wed 16 September 6pm ET, published Thu 17 September): no match since
  // Tuesday's cup tie, so the Szoboszlai volley plate is carried and generatedAt re-stamped only. The lead
  // rotated onto the Carabao Cup fourth-round draw, made at Old Trafford on Wednesday night: Liverpool host
  // Chelsea in the week commencing 26 October, Xabi Alonso back at Anfield a third autumn running with a
  // third club. A cup draw is not a single photographable still, so NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5.
  // Morning pass (Wed 16 September, ~4am ET): no match since Tuesday's cup tie, so the Szoboszlai volley plate is carried
  // and generatedAt re-stamped only. The lead rotated off the raw 3-1 result onto Sunday: Iraola's homecoming to Bournemouth,
  // read through the scrutiny around him (unbeaten yet 'under serious pressure' per Yahoo/LiveScore, Hughes gone to Al-Hilal),
  // with tonight's Carabao Cup fourth-round draw the day's other fixed point. A homecoming preview and a cup draw are not
  // single photographable stills, so NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5; the Szoboszlai plate stands as the carried hero.
  // Table byte-identical from ESPN, Liverpool eighth. All eight generatedAt stamps 08:30Z.
  // Evening pass (Tue 15 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): a match was played, and it leads every surface.
  // Liverpool 3-1 Tottenham at Anfield, Carabao Cup third round, with TEN changes and Joe Gomez captaining
  // on a first appearance since a July muscle injury. Mac Allister into the top corner on 21; Gakpo the
  // second shortly after the interval; Gallagher headed Spurs back into it from a corner before the 70th;
  // Mamardashvili, in his first appearance of the season, made a significant late save; Szoboszlai, off the
  // bench, volleyed the third from around thirty yards in stoppage time. Andy Robertson came on for Udogie
  // on 57 and was given a standing ovation from all four stands on his first Anfield return. Fans also spotted
  // Iraola passing his own match notes down the bench to the academy players. First win since Ipswich and the
  // first time this season Liverpool have scored three. NO expected-goals figures had been published at the
  // time of writing, so the FORM_TRENDS card for this tie carries nulls with pending: true rather than an
  // estimate. NEXT_MATCH rolled to Bournemouth away, Sunday 20 September, 2pm at the Vitality, Sky Sports
  // Main Event, Andoni Iraola's first return to the club he managed until the summer; the OPPOSITION dossier
  // was rebuilt from scratch for Marco Rose's side, the first team in Premier League history to lead in each
  // of its opening four fixtures and win none of them. Fourth-round draw Wednesday night after Man Utd vs
  // Brighton, ties in the week beginning 26 October. STANDINGS byte-identical from ESPN, Liverpool eighth.
  // A thirty-yard volley IS a photographable moment under STEP 7.5, so a Track 1 plate was generated (the
  // strike, no text) and the Track 2 brief below is the open request for Antigravity. All eight generatedAt
  // stamps 22:45Z.
  // Morning pass (Tue 15 September, ~4am ET): MATCHDAY, but the match is tonight and has not been played, so there is no
  // new photographable moment yet. The Jacquet plate is carried again and generatedAt re-stamped; the `focus`/`brief`
  // below still describe the Fulham clearance, now the edition's background rather than its lead. The lead rotated off
  // Monday's press conference onto the tie itself: Tottenham at Anfield, 8pm, the Carabao Cup third round and Iraola's
  // first domestic cup tie, a heavily rotated XI (Koumas through the middle behind a returning Gakpo, Ngumoha and Munoz
  // wide, Nyoni and Mac Allister screening, Isak/Van Dijk/Szoboszlai/Wirtz rested), with Andy Robertson's first return to
  // Anfield in Tottenham colours the night's sub-plot. No new image queued under STEP 7.5 (a pre-match preview is not a
  // single still); Antigravity may generate a post-match hero image tonight if the tie produces one. Table unchanged from
  // ESPN, Liverpool eighth. All eight generatedAt stamps 08:30Z.
  // Evening pass (Mon 14 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): no match since Saturday, so the Jacquet plate is carried and
  // generatedAt re-stamped only. The `focus` line and `brief` below still describe the Fulham clearance, which is now the
  // third story on the page. The lead rotated to Iraola's Monday press conference at the AXA: Mamardashvili confirmed to
  // start (a first appearance of the season, the manager volunteering that he tried to sign him for Bournemouth), Gomez
  // upgraded from doubt to 'available for tomorrow', and the manager's own account of a schedule he called the worst
  // scenario. A press conference has no single still photograph in it, so NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5 and the
  // brief below is intentionally left at the last genuinely photographable moment; Antigravity should treat it as served.
  // Also this pass: Tottenham's team news reversed the weekend's reading (Tonali out with a knock, Porro and Kulusevski
  // out, Richarlison excluded from the squad entirely, Udogie back, Van de Ven in fact fit and a starter at Everton), and
  // the table moved without Liverpool playing, Leeds beating Newcastle 4-1 at Elland Road to go third and Liverpool
  // slipping from seventh to eighth on the same six points.
  // Machine-readable handoff written by the daily run, consumed by Antigravity.
  // Evening pass (Sat 12 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): a match was played. Liverpool 0-0 Fulham at Anfield,
  // the first blank under Iraola and a fourth straight Anfield league draw, the first such run since November
  // 2011 per Opta. Jacquet cleared Garcia's shot off the line on 12 after Alisson's short pass to a marked
  // Gravenberch (King's penalty appeal waved away); Munoz headed a corner against the bar on 22; Leno saved
  // from Isak and Mac Allister; Alisson tipped King's curler wide on 76; Muniz missed on 79. Opta: 1.13 xG from
  // 14 shots to 0.71 from 10. Three changes (Tsimikas, Gravenberch, Munoz) all withdrawn by the hour; Gakpo back
  // from the bench; Gomez not in the squad. Iraola: 'a lack of freshness, definitely, we cannot hide it'.
  // The result leads every surface. Next: Tottenham, Carabao Cup third round, Anfield, Tuesday 8pm, ITV and
  // Sky; NEXT_MATCH rolled forward and the OPPOSITION dossier rebuilt for De Zerbi's goalless side. A goal-line
  // clearance IS a photographable moment under STEP 7.5, so a Track 1 plate was generated (the clearance, no
  // text) and the Track 2 brief below is the open request for Antigravity (COVER-00001). The limn-editor-enhance
  // skill was not present on this mount, so the request is recorded here and in cover-brief.json only.
  // Morning pass (Sat 12 September): MATCHDAY. Fulham at Anfield today at 3pm; no match or ruling-out
  // since Wednesday's Atletico win, table byte-identical from ESPN. Lead rotated off Friday evening's
  // Ekitike-January anchor onto the fixture itself; Gakpo the lone doubt into matchday, Barcola and Kerkez
  // cleared, Gomez in line for a first bench. Mac Allister strike plate carried and re-stamped.
  // Morning pass (Sun 13 September, ~4am ET): no match since Saturday; table byte-identical from ESPN (the
  // Manchester derby is this afternoon, unplayed). Lead rotated off the Fulham result onto the Sunday-morning
  // reckoning on Iraola: 'officially under serious pressure' (AnfieldWatch/LiveScore/Yahoo) after one win in
  // four, with no sporting director (Hughes long gone to Al-Hilal, Gordon/FSG hunting a fifth since 2022), his
  // fuller 'what was lacking was quite clear' post-mortem, and Pablo Barrios (Atletico) the one new January/
  // summer midfield thread. NOT a sacking; contradiction sweep clean. A manager-pressure lead is not
  // photographable, so no new image queued; Jacquet clearance plate carried and generatedAt re-stamped.
  // Evening pass (Sun 13 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): no match since Saturday, so the Jacquet plate is carried
  // and generatedAt re-stamped only. NOTE: the `focus` line above and the `brief` below still describe the Fulham
  // clearance, which is now the SECOND story on the page, not the lead. The lead rotated to the captain's contract:
  // Liverpool will not open Van Dijk talks until 2027, no decision before April, the deal expiring that summer
  // (Football Insider, carried by Yahoo / CaughtOffside / Sports Mole). A contract that is deliberately not being
  // discussed has no single still photograph in it, so NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5 and the brief below
  // is intentionally left at the last genuinely photographable moment. Antigravity should treat it as already served.
  // The table moved without Liverpool playing: City won the derby with ten men, Brighton won 5-0 at Coventry,
  // Liverpool slip to seventh on the same six points.
  // Evening pass (Fri 11 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): no match since Wednesday. The lead moved to the one
  // new fact from Friday's briefing: Iraola put a January date, of sorts, on Ekitike's Achilles. Plate carried.
  // Evening pass (Wed 9 September): a match was played. Liverpool 2-1 Atletico Madrid at Anfield, the Champions
  // League opener: Llorente 17, Szoboszlai 40, Mac Allister 50. Opta: 1.68 xG from 14 shots to 0.81 from 9.
  // Track 1 plate 2026-09-09-mac-allister-strike.svg.
  // Evening pass (Sat 5 September): Richard Hughes stepped down as sporting director. Track 1 plate 2026-09-05-hughes-exit.svg.

The Europa stripe sits at Leeds, a single goal of difference above Liverpool. The fixtures after the break are what give the table its edge: City, Brentford, Brighton and Arsenal, the current top four, in consecutive league games. At the bottom, Bournemouth, Fulham and Tottenham are still waiting for a first win.",

    "Brighton": "Third on ten with the league's best goal difference, asking £80m for Minteh per CaughtOffside, and at Anfield on 25 October.",
    "Brentford": "Fourth, unbeaten in five and the last club inside the Champions League stripe. Liverpool visit on 17 October, the date the reporting marks as Gakpo's earliest plausible return.",

  summary:
    "Wednesday morning, and the freshest Liverpool line was written in Prague: Rio Ngumoha came on for Bukayo Saka after seventy-one minutes of England's 2-0 Nations League win over Czechia on Tuesday night and, at eighteen years and thirty-one days, became the third-youngest player to appear for England in a competitive match, behind only Jude Bellingham and Wayne Rooney, per Sports Mole. It matters at Anfield because the flank he took is the one Cody Gakpo's ankle has emptied before Manchester City on 11 October; Victor Munoz, this tracker's current pick there, came off the bench in Spain's 4-1 win over Croatia in Seville, and Trey Nyoni set up a goal for England's Under-20s against France, per Liverpool FC. September ends today, and with it Federico Chiesa's own target for a return to group training, still without club confirmation, while LiveScore's morning round-up carries AnfieldWatch's report that Inter are considering a January move and Goal's account of Karl-Heinz Rummenigge saying he is surprised by Florian Wirtz's struggles. The contract file ticks on behind it: AnfieldWatch expects no Alisson talks until later in the year, and CaughtOffside adds Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite, priced at £80m, to the centre-back reading. At the other end of the fixture, Antoine Semenyo's swollen leg, which kept him out of Ghana's window (Sports Mole), is City's one live doubt beside Jeremy Doku.",

Read Man City's tracker, updated on 28 September, still has Jeremy Doku, calf, as the only senior absentee, Maresca saying he needs some more days, and Phil Foden serves the last game of a three-match domestic ban at Anfield. Off the field the reported independent-commission verdict on 114 of the 115 Premier League charges still carries no sanction, with an appeal expected, and Ian Wright used Wednesday's papers to call for an unprecedented punishment. On the grass they are first on fifteen, five wins from five in Enzo Maresca's first season after Pep Guardiola, yet Opta's expected-points model, reported by Read Man City, has them second behind Arsenal. Sunderland's three goals and 3.57 expected at the Etihad remain the clearest evidence of a defence that concedes.",
  shape:
    "Maresca has kept the possession spine and loosened everything in front of it, which is why City look like a scoring machine and a defensive argument at the same time. The back four sits high with Gvardiol at left-back stepping into midfield and Matheus Nunes giving width on the right; Enzo Fernandez and Elliot Anderson screen in a double pivot that is more about ball progression than protection. Rayan Cherki plays between the lines and carries, with Antoine Semenyo and Iliman Ndiaye on the flanks and Haaland pinning the centre-backs. The pattern that beat Sunderland twice over and nearly cost them the afternoon is the same one: when the ball turns over in City's half, the space between that high line and Donnarumma is enormous, and Sunderland needed very little invitation to run into it three times on 20 September.",

The strength Liverpool bring is the defence: an expected-goals-against of 6.12 that only Arsenal and Forest have bettered, three clean sheets in a row, and in Jacquet a centre-back whose 16.4 line-breaking passes per ninety (Empire of the Kop) offer a way through City's press that does not run through Van Dijk alone.",

  depthRisk: [
    { position: "Right-back", level: "high", detail: "Still the department with no answer inside the building, though its incumbent came through Monday in good order: Araujo played ninety minutes of Uruguay's 4-1 win in Seoul, booked, eleven defensive contributions (Rush The Kop). Ronald Araujo, a centre-half by trade, has started five consecutive league games at right-back and the BBC's verdict at Bournemouth was that he defends the position comfortably but offers little going forward, the accurate summary of a working compromise. The department does not get deeper for three months: Conor Bradley's knee has no club date and FotMob's listing pushes him to early January 2027, Frimpong, cut from the Dutch 23 for Serbia on Sunday, is the cup alternative, Gomez is the only specialist and stays at the AXA through the break. Manchester City attack that flank with Antoine Semenyo, who withdrew from Ghana's window with a swollen leg and is a minor doubt (Sports Mole). The movement this week was reportorial and doubled: Liverpool are linked with Benfica's eighteen-year-old Daniel Banjaqui at a reported 50m euros (Anfield Watch via CaughtOffside) and Feyenoord's Givairo Read (TeamTalk), both January-shaped projects rather than September solutions. The injury this week came one layer down: Isaac Mabaya, a twenty-one-year-old right-back who plays for the Under-21s, withdrew from Zimbabwe's squad with a groin problem sustained in the Under-21s' win over Brighton on 19 September (This Is Anfield / Nehanda Radio)." },
    { position: "Centre-forward", level: "critical", detail: "Monday tightened the scenario this entry has warned about since August. Gakpo, who led the line in the cup and was the first cover at nine, is reported out for several weeks with an ankle injury after withdrawing from the Dutch squad; Isak, the first-choice nine and the scorer of four of seven league goals, is still being assessed for a thigh problem Graham Potter calls small. Ekitike's Achilles keeps January as the club's horizon and Chiesa has not played since August. If Isak is not right for City, Koumas, twenty-one, makes a full league debut against the leaders, or Munoz is tried centrally, as Rousing The Kop suggests. No market until January." },
    { position: "Centre-back", level: "medium", detail: "Healthy now, uncertain later, which is a new kind of risk for this entry. Van Dijk and Jacquet have kept three consecutive league clean sheets together, and Empire of the Kop's numbers have Jacquet, twenty-one, already passing through lines at 16.4 per ninety to his captain's 16.2. The longer-dated question moved on Tuesday: Mundo Deportivo, via Goal, and Sports Mole report Real Madrid weighing a free transfer for Van Dijk, whose contract ends in summer 2027 with no renewal offered. By Tuesday night the reporting had dates attached: Galatasaray said to be ready to approach in January and Liverpool tracking Inter's Alessandro Bastoni as a successor (AnfieldWatch via LiveScore). Behind the pair Gomez is fit, Araujo covers at a pinch, and Leoni is due into group training with Sports Mole pencilling mid-October; Endo, the emergency fifth centre-half, is listed for sale in January." },
    { position: "Left-back", level: "high", detail: "Unchanged in level; Kerkez came through ninety minutes in Belfast on Monday, so availability is not the question, and the last club game supplied evidence rather than relief. Milos Kerkez started against the club that sold him and the BBC's report is that he struggled initially and was regularly targeted with the crossfield ball over his head, with effort rather than quality the thing worth praising. Tsimikas was an unused substitute. Two senior options, neither of whom the reporting believes is at the manager's standard, no market until January, and Semenyo attacking that side on 11 October." },
    { position: "Wide forward", level: "critical", detail: "Critical since Monday, and the week's only good news for the department arrived abroad. Gakpo's ankle, reported as several weeks, takes out the player who started on the right at Bournemouth and created three chances, and leaves Barcola, Munoz and Ngumoha to cover two flanks against City, LASK and Brentford. On Tuesday night Ngumoha came on for Saka in England's 2-0 win in Prague, the third-youngest competitive England player at eighteen years and thirty-one days (Sports Mole), and Munoz came off the bench in Spain's 4-1 win over Croatia (Liverpool FC), so both deputies return with minutes. Chiesa's end-of-month target for group training falls due today unconfirmed, Inter are reported to be weighing January (AnfieldWatch via LiveScore), and he is still the only reinforcement in sight." },
    { position: "Central midfield", level: "medium", detail: "Held at medium on availability. The contract stand-off moved in tone on Tuesday, Mac Allister telling reporters he was very sad not to be offered terms but that two more years would be perfect, and Sports Mole and Goal reported the club still wants Inter's Aleksandar Stankovic after a summer refusal. Mac Allister and Szoboszlai started together and the BBC's reading was that Mac Allister found space to open the game up after a slow start while Szoboszlai played with purpose, was booked after half-time, and put two free-kicks narrowly wide. Gravenberch came on for the last nine minutes, the clearest signal yet of the order. Endo, available all season as the emergency fifth centre-back, is listed for a January exit, and Mac Allister is running down a deal the club has not offered to extend." },

    "The four league games after the break, City, Brentford, Brighton and Arsenal inside three weeks with LASK and Chelsea's cup visit between them, are the whole of this projection's next chapter. Six points from them would bring the pace to fifteen from nine, 1.67 a game, a Europa-band season; nine or more and sixty-eight starts to look earned rather than borrowed from a soft opening. Three or fewer, and the unbeaten start becomes a footnote. Brentford on 17 October remains the reporting's earliest plausible date for Gakpo, so City at least will be played without him.",
