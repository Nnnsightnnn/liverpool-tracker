// ─── Cover Image (edition hero — tied to the lead story) ────────────────────
// The cover renders `src` full-bleed behind the masthead with a legibility
// scrim; if `src` is null or the file fails to load, the cover falls back to
// the pure-type masthead. `generatedAt` doubles as a cache-buster (?v=).
//
// TWO-TRACK PIPELINE (see docs/COVER-IMAGE-PIPELINE.md):
//   • The daily liverpool-tracker-update run regenerates a deterministic SVG
//     "editorial plate" (public/assets/cover/*.svg) from the lead story, so the
//     cover always has a visual, and writes `brief` below.
//   • Antigravity ("agy") reads `brief`, generates a premium photographic image
//     when the lead is genuinely visual, drops the JPG in public/assets/cover/,
//     and repoints `src` + `credit` + `generatedAt` at it.
// `focus` is the one-line "most important focus of the latest edition."

  // squad decision: Liverpool have put Wataru Endo up for sale for January, six competitive games into Iraola's

  // Evening pass (Tue 15 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): a match was played, and it leads every surface.
  // Liverpool 3-1 Tottenham at Anfield, Carabao Cup third round, with TEN changes and Joe Gomez captaining
  // on a first appearance since a July muscle injury. Mac Allister into the top corner on 21; Gakpo the
  // second shortly after the interval; Gallagher headed Spurs back into it from a corner before the 70th;
  // Mamardashvili, in his first appearance of the season, made a significant late save; Szoboszlai, off the
  // bench, volleyed the third from around thirty yards in stoppage time. Andy Robertson came on for Udogie
  // on 57 and was given a standing ovation from all four stands on his first Anfield return. Fans also spotted
  // Iraola passing his own match notes down the bench to the academy players. First win since Ipswich and the
  // first time this season Liverpool have scored three. NO expected-goals figures had been published at the
  // time of writing, so the FORM_TRENDS card for this tie carries nulls with pending: true rather than an
  // estimate. NEXT_MATCH rolled to Bournemouth away, Sunday 20 September, 2pm at the Vitality, Sky Sports
  // Main Event, Andoni Iraola's first return to the club he managed until the summer; the OPPOSITION dossier
  // was rebuilt from scratch for Marco Rose's side, the first team in Premier League history to lead in each
  // of its opening four fixtures and win none of them. Fourth-round draw Wednesday night after Man Utd vs
  // Brighton, ties in the week beginning 26 October. STANDINGS byte-identical from ESPN, Liverpool eighth.
  // A thirty-yard volley IS a photographable moment under STEP 7.5, so a Track 1 plate was generated (the
  // strike, no text) and the Track 2 brief below is the open request for Antigravity. All eight generatedAt
  // stamps 22:45Z.
  // Morning pass (Tue 15 September, ~4am ET): MATCHDAY, but the match is tonight and has not been played, so there is no
  // new photographable moment yet. The Jacquet plate is carried again and generatedAt re-stamped; the `focus`/`brief`
  // below still describe the Fulham clearance, now the edition's background rather than its lead. The lead rotated off
  // Monday's press conference onto the tie itself: Tottenham at Anfield, 8pm, the Carabao Cup third round and Iraola's
  // first domestic cup tie, a heavily rotated XI (Koumas through the middle behind a returning Gakpo, Ngumoha and Munoz
  // wide, Nyoni and Mac Allister screening, Isak/Van Dijk/Szoboszlai/Wirtz rested), with Andy Robertson's first return to
  // Anfield in Tottenham colours the night's sub-plot. No new image queued under STEP 7.5 (a pre-match preview is not a
  // single still); Antigravity may generate a post-match hero image tonight if the tie produces one. Table unchanged from
  // ESPN, Liverpool eighth. All eight generatedAt stamps 08:30Z.
  // Evening pass (Mon 14 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): no match since Saturday, so the Jacquet plate is carried and
  // generatedAt re-stamped only. The `focus` line and `brief` below still describe the Fulham clearance, which is now the
  // third story on the page. The lead rotated to Iraola's Monday press conference at the AXA: Mamardashvili confirmed to
  // start (a first appearance of the season, the manager volunteering that he tried to sign him for Bournemouth), Gomez
  // upgraded from doubt to 'available for tomorrow', and the manager's own account of a schedule he called the worst
  // scenario. A press conference has no single still photograph in it, so NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5 and the
  // brief below is intentionally left at the last genuinely photographable moment; Antigravity should treat it as served.
  // Also this pass: Tottenham's team news reversed the weekend's reading (Tonali out with a knock, Porro and Kulusevski
  // out, Richarlison excluded from the squad entirely, Udogie back, Van de Ven in fact fit and a starter at Everton), and
  // the table moved without Liverpool playing, Leeds beating Newcastle 4-1 at Elland Road to go third and Liverpool
  // slipping from seventh to eighth on the same six points.
  // Machine-readable handoff written by the daily run, consumed by Antigravity.
  // Evening pass (Sat 12 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): a match was played. Liverpool 0-0 Fulham at Anfield,
  // the first blank under Iraola and a fourth straight Anfield league draw, the first such run since November
  // 2011 per Opta. Jacquet cleared Garcia's shot off the line on 12 after Alisson's short pass to a marked
  // Gravenberch (King's penalty appeal waved away); Munoz headed a corner against the bar on 22; Leno saved
  // from Isak and Mac Allister; Alisson tipped King's curler wide on 76; Muniz missed on 79. Opta: 1.13 xG from
  // 14 shots to 0.71 from 10. Three changes (Tsimikas, Gravenberch, Munoz) all withdrawn by the hour; Gakpo back
  // from the bench; Gomez not in the squad. Iraola: 'a lack of freshness, definitely, we cannot hide it'.
  // The result leads every surface. Next: Tottenham, Carabao Cup third round, Anfield, Tuesday 8pm, ITV and
  // Sky; NEXT_MATCH rolled forward and the OPPOSITION dossier rebuilt for De Zerbi's goalless side. A goal-line
  // clearance IS a photographable moment under STEP 7.5, so a Track 1 plate was generated (the clearance, no
  // text) and the Track 2 brief below is the open request for Antigravity (COVER-00001). The limn-editor-enhance
  // skill was not present on this mount, so the request is recorded here and in cover-brief.json only.
  // Morning pass (Sat 12 September): MATCHDAY. Fulham at Anfield today at 3pm; no match or ruling-out
  // since Wednesday's Atletico win, table byte-identical from ESPN. Lead rotated off Friday evening's
  // Ekitike-January anchor onto the fixture itself; Gakpo the lone doubt into matchday, Barcola and Kerkez
  // cleared, Gomez in line for a first bench. Mac Allister strike plate carried and re-stamped.
  // Morning pass (Sun 13 September, ~4am ET): no match since Saturday; table byte-identical from ESPN (the
  // Manchester derby is this afternoon, unplayed). Lead rotated off the Fulham result onto the Sunday-morning
  // reckoning on Iraola: 'officially under serious pressure' (AnfieldWatch/LiveScore/Yahoo) after one win in
  // four, with no sporting director (Hughes long gone to Al-Hilal, Gordon/FSG hunting a fifth since 2022), his
  // fuller 'what was lacking was quite clear' post-mortem, and Pablo Barrios (Atletico) the one new January/
  // summer midfield thread. NOT a sacking; contradiction sweep clean. A manager-pressure lead is not
  // photographable, so no new image queued; Jacquet clearance plate carried and generatedAt re-stamped.
  // Evening pass (Sun 13 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): no match since Saturday, so the Jacquet plate is carried
  // and generatedAt re-stamped only. NOTE: the `focus` line above and the `brief` below still describe the Fulham
  // clearance, which is now the SECOND story on the page, not the lead. The lead rotated to the captain's contract:
  // Liverpool will not open Van Dijk talks until 2027, no decision before April, the deal expiring that summer
  // (Football Insider, carried by Yahoo / CaughtOffside / Sports Mole). A contract that is deliberately not being
  // discussed has no single still photograph in it, so NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5 and the brief below
  // is intentionally left at the last genuinely photographable moment. Antigravity should treat it as already served.
  // The table moved without Liverpool playing: City won the derby with ten men, Brighton won 5-0 at Coventry,
  // Liverpool slip to seventh on the same six points.
  // Evening pass (Fri 11 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): no match since Wednesday. The lead moved to the one
  // new fact from Friday's briefing: Iraola put a January date, of sorts, on Ekitike's Achilles. Plate carried.
  // Evening pass (Wed 9 September): a match was played. Liverpool 2-1 Atletico Madrid at Anfield, the Champions
  // League opener: Llorente 17, Szoboszlai 40, Mac Allister 50. Opta: 1.68 xG from 14 shots to 0.81 from 9.
  // Track 1 plate 2026-09-09-mac-allister-strike.svg.

  overview: "Six goals in Linz do not reach this table, which still has Liverpool ninth on nine with a goal difference of zero, one of four sides on nine and a point behind Brentford, Everton and Chelsea (ESPN). The league's own story is unchanged since Sunday: Manchester City six from six and three clear of Arsenal, Brighton third with the best goal difference in the division, and Bournemouth, Tottenham and Fulham still without a league win at the bottom. The Champions League stripe is drawn at fourth, where Brentford sit unbeaten, and Saturday's game at the Gtech is therefore the rare autumn fixture with a direct swap on offer: a Liverpool win lifts them above their hosts on twelve. Matchweek seven is the next movement, and it starts with that game at three o'clock.",

Frimpong had headed a fourth in between and Koumas added a sixth.

  summary: "Liverpool won 6-3 at LASK on Wednesday night, and Bradley Barcola, without a goal or an assist in six appearances since his summer move from PSG, scored the first three of his Liverpool career: on twenty-four minutes, ninety-six seconds after Ronald Araujo's headed opener, on thirty-seven from Florian Wirtz's pass, and on sixty-six from Jeremie Frimpong's cross (Sky Sports; ORF; ESPN). Frimpong headed a fourth from Kostas Tsimikas's cross and Lewis Koumas scored his first Champions League goal, but LASK then scored three times in fourteen minutes, the first a minute after Iraola replaced both centre-backs with Van Dijk and Gomez at 4-0 on sixty-two, a change he admitted afterwards was 'not the right thing to do as a manager' (Liverpool FC; Sky Sports). Liverpool had 26 shots to 12 and 3.34 expected goals to 2.02 on FotMob's model, nineteen of the shots in a first half Sky Sports calls a Champions League record for an away side, and finish the night on six points from two in the league phase (FotMob; Goal). Van Dijk, Kerkez, Mac Allister and Munoz were rested for Saturday, when Liverpool, ninth on nine, visit unbeaten fourth-placed Brentford at 3pm without the suspended Gravenberch and with Szoboszlai, Isak and Gakpo still doubts (beIN Sports; DaveOCKOP; Brentford FC; ESPN).",

A win at Brentford, where Liverpool lost 3-2 last season (Brentford FC), would put them above the side holding the Champions League stripe; Brighton and Arsenal then come to Anfield, where Liverpool have not won a league game in five (Opta Analyst). Seven points from the three would lift the pace above 1.75 a game; two or fewer would leave it near 1.2. Palace away and United at home then close the six.",
