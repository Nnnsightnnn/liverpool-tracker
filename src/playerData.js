// ─── Cover Image (edition hero — tied to the lead story) ────────────────────
// The cover renders `src` full-bleed behind the masthead with a legibility
// scrim; if `src` is null or the file fails to load, the cover falls back to
// the pure-type masthead. `generatedAt` doubles as a cache-buster (?v=).
//
// TWO-TRACK PIPELINE (see docs/COVER-IMAGE-PIPELINE.md):
//   • The daily liverpool-tracker-update run regenerates a deterministic SVG
//     "editorial plate" (public/assets/cover/*.svg) from the lead story, so the
//     cover always has a visual, and writes `brief` below.
//   • Antigravity ("agy") reads `brief`, generates a premium photographic image
//     when the lead is genuinely visual, drops the JPG in public/assets/cover/,
//     and repoints `src` + `credit` + `generatedAt` at it.
// `focus` is the one-line "most important focus of the latest edition."

  // Evening pass (Fri 25 September, ~6pm ET): NO MATCH, international break. The lead rotates off the morning's
  // Amsterdam fallout onto Friday night's internationals: Isak's 20th-minute opener in Sweden 2-1 Romania, in the week he and
  // Jacquet were shortlisted for September's Player of the Month (with City's Semenyo). CORRECTION: Alisson was left out by
  // Brazil and is at Kirkby; Mamardashvili is the goalkeeper away (Georgia, beaten by a 99th-minute NI winner). New: Konde to
  // Man Utd, Mabaya groin (Zimbabwe withdrawal), Nyoni on the six. NO new image queued (an away international goal is not a
  // Liverpool still). Szoboszlai plate carried, all 8 generatedAt 22:30Z.
  // Morning pass (Fri 25 September, ~4am ET): NO MATCH, international break. The lead rotates off Thursday's internationals
  // preview onto the fallout: Gakpo's stoppage-time volley (90+2) rescued Netherlands 1-1 Germany and denied Klopp a
  // winning debut, Van Dijk called Germany's goal-while-Brobbey-down a 'disgrace', Klopp answered 'no guilty conscience',
  // Kimmich backed Klopp. New: Iraola nominated Sept Manager of the Month (with Maresca, Hurzeler); Klopp held Wirtz out
  // of Germany's opening games (Serbia 1 Oct, Greece 4 Oct); Iraola working a skeleton group at the AXA. NO new image

  // ---- prior ----
  // Morning pass (Thu 24 September, ~4am ET): NO MATCH, international break. The lead rotates off the evening's Ward
  // frame onto tonight's internationals opening: Van Dijk's Netherlands v Klopp's Germany in Amsterdam (7.45pm), four
  // Reds in the Dutch squad (Van Dijk, Gravenberch, Gakpo, recalled Frimpong), Van Dijk committed to play on until
  // 'at least' 37 after Xavi's Merseyside visit. Ward reappointment firms with Paul Joyce (The Times) now alongside

  // plate carried. Table byte-identical from ESPN, Liverpool sixth. All eight generatedAt stamps 08:30Z.
  // Evening pass (Wed 23 September, 6pm ET): NO MATCH, international break. The lead rotates off the morning's Leoni
  // training-pitch frame onto the sporting-director story firming: James Pearce (The Athletic) calling Julian Ward's expected
  // appointment 'a lot of sense', with Sky's Lyall Thomas naming Brentford's Lee Dykes as a possible partner. Reported,
  // not announced. Behind it: Opta's expected-points model rating City 5.8 points above their chances, Leoni's first ACL
  // anniversary, the BBC's Koumas profile, Robertson on Stick to Football, the November TV moves. NO new image queued under

  // Evening pass (Tue 22 September, 6pm ET): NO MATCH, international break. The lead rotates to The Athletic's
  // report that Julian Ward is set to return as sporting director (reported, not announced), with Mac Allister's
  // fuller 'very sad'/'that's perfect' interview, Van Dijk's Netherlands commitment to Euro 2028, Foden's ban
  // running out at Anfield and the U21s' 7-6 shootout win at Rochdale behind it. NO new image queued under

  // re-stamped, cover-brief.json re-mirrored. All eight generatedAt stamps 22:30Z.
  // Morning pass (Tue 22 September, ~4am ET): NO MATCH, international break. The lead is the Florian Wirtz row:
  // Andoni Iraola defending him to Sky Sports ('much happier with his second half than his first') and calling
  // Klopp's split-squad decision 'very smart', with Wirtz answering the criticism on Instagram ('Into the
  // international break with a win'). Second surface is the right-back file gaining two fresh January-shaped names,
  // Benfica's Banjaqui (50m euros) and Feyenoord's Read. NO new image queued under STEP 7.5: a social-media reply

  // re-stamped, cover-brief.json re-mirrored to this morning's lead. All eight generatedAt stamps 08:30Z.
  // Evening pass (Mon 21 September, 6pm ET): NO MATCH, international break. The lead is Alexis Mac Allister
  // telling ESPN there is "no firm decision" on a Liverpool contract the club has declined to open talks about,
  // with Jamie Carragher's call to drop Florian Wirtz for Manchester City the evening's second surface. Both are
  // interviews. NO new image queued under STEP 7.5: neither a contract stand-off nor a podcast verdict resolves
  // into a single still, and the skill caps queueing at one genuinely visual moment per edition. The standing
  // candidate for a future plate remains Jeremy Jacquet. Szoboszlai plate carried, generatedAt re-stamped only.
  // Previous evening pass (Sun 20 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): MATCH PLAYED. Bournemouth 0-1 Liverpool at the Vitality,
  // Isak turning in a blocked Gakpo cross on 57 for a third consecutive Premier League clean sheet, a rise from
  // tenth to sixth, and Iraola the first Liverpool manager unbeaten in his opening five league games since Joe
  // Fagan in 1983 (Opta). The Szoboszlai plate is carried one more edition and generatedAt re-stamped only.
  // NO new image queued under STEP 7.5: the goal was a six-yard tap-in from a deflected block, which is decisive
  // without being a single photographable still, and the skill caps queueing at one genuinely visual moment per
  // edition. If Antigravity wants a plate for the next edition, the candidate is Jacquet, twenty-one, taking the
  // highest rating on the field on the afternoon France called him up. STANDINGS rebuilt from ESPN (Liverpool
  // sixth on nine). OPPOSITION rebuilt from scratch for Manchester City at Anfield, 11 October. All eight
  // generatedAt stamps 22:30Z.
  // Morning pass (Sun 20 September, ~4am ET): MATCHDAY. Bournemouth away at 2pm at the Vitality, unplayed at the time of
  // writing, so the Szoboszlai plate is carried and generatedAt re-stamped only. The lead rotated off Saturday's table
  // movement onto the game itself: Iraola's first return to the club he managed for three years, the game in hand finally
  // paid, and the one live team-news question being Cody Gakpo's adductor doubt ('I cannot guarantee it', per This Is
  // Anfield). A matchday preview is not a single photographable still, so NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5;
  // Antigravity may generate a post-match hero image later if the game produces one. Table byte-identical from ESPN,
  // Liverpool tenth. All eight generatedAt stamps 08:30Z.
  // Evening pass (Sat 19 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): still no Liverpool match since Tuesday's cup tie, so the
  // Szoboszlai plate is carried and generatedAt re-stamped only. The lead rotated off the morning's homecoming-eve
  // preview onto Saturday's five Premier League results, which dropped Liverpool from eighth to tenth without them
  // playing: Brighton 3-0 Arsenal ended the champions' perfect start, Everton and Newcastle won, Coventry took a
  // first points and first goal at Forest, and Tottenham scored for the first time and lost 3-2 to Villa anyway.
  // The club also confirmed Chelsea at Anfield in the Carabao Cup fourth round on 28 October and the Champions
  // League trip to LASK on 14 October. A league table rearranging itself is not a single photographable still, so
  // NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5. All eight generatedAt stamps 22:30Z.
  // Morning pass (Sat 19 September, ~4am ET): no match since Tuesday's cup tie and the international break now open, so
  // the Szoboszlai volley plate is carried and generatedAt re-stamped only. The lead rotated off Friday evening's Ngumoha
  // call-up onto the eve of Sunday's fixture: Iraola's homecoming to Bournemouth, team news locked and the predicted league
  // XI settled, the last soft game before City, Brentford, Brighton and Arsenal. A matchday-eve build-up is not a single
  // photographable still, so NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5. Table byte-identical from ESPN, Liverpool eighth. All
  // eight generatedAt stamps 08:30Z.
  // Evening pass (Fri 18 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): no match since Tuesday's cup tie, so the Szoboszlai plate is
  // carried and generatedAt re-stamped only. The lead rotated off the morning's homecoming preview onto Rio Ngumoha's
  // call-up to Thomas Tuchel's England squad, announced Friday morning, plus Iraola's 1.30pm press conference. A squad
  // list read out in London is not a single photographable still, so NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5.
  // Morning pass (Fri 18 September, ~4am ET): no match since Tuesday's cup tie, so the Szoboszlai volley plate is
  // carried and generatedAt re-stamped only. The lead rotated off Thursday's Endo sale onto Sunday: Iraola's homecoming
  // to Bournemouth, previewed on the day of his 1.30pm press conference and the last fixture before the international
  // break, with the Endo/Ngumoha business the backdrop. A homecoming preview is not a single photographable still, so
  // NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5. Table byte-identical from ESPN, Liverpool eighth. All eight generatedAt stamps 08:30Z.
  // Evening pass (Thu 17 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): no match since Tuesday's cup tie, so the Szoboszlai
  // volley plate is carried and generatedAt re-stamped only. The lead rotated off the cup draw onto Thursday's
  // squad decision: Liverpool have put Wataru Endo up for sale for January, six competitive games into Iraola's
  // first season, with Ben Jacobs the source under CaughtOffside, Football365, TeamTalk, SportBible and
  // Sportskeeda; the counterweight is the push to tie Rio Ngumoha to a new long-term deal inside a month.
  // A transfer-list decision and a contract negotiation are not single photographable stills, so NO new image
  // was queued under STEP 7.5. All eight generatedAt stamps 22:30Z.
  // Evening/overnight pass (started Wed 16 September 6pm ET, published Thu 17 September): no match since
  // Tuesday's cup tie, so the Szoboszlai volley plate is carried and generatedAt re-stamped only. The lead
  // rotated onto the Carabao Cup fourth-round draw, made at Old Trafford on Wednesday night: Liverpool host
  // Chelsea in the week commencing 26 October, Xabi Alonso back at Anfield a third autumn running with a
  // third club. A cup draw is not a single photographable still, so NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5.
  // Morning pass (Wed 16 September, ~4am ET): no match since Tuesday's cup tie, so the Szoboszlai volley plate is carried
  // and generatedAt re-stamped only. The lead rotated off the raw 3-1 result onto Sunday: Iraola's homecoming to Bournemouth,
  // read through the scrutiny around him (unbeaten yet 'under serious pressure' per Yahoo/LiveScore, Hughes gone to Al-Hilal),
  // with tonight's Carabao Cup fourth-round draw the day's other fixed point. A homecoming preview and a cup draw are not
  // single photographable stills, so NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5; the Szoboszlai plate stands as the carried hero.
  // Table byte-identical from ESPN, Liverpool eighth. All eight generatedAt stamps 08:30Z.
  // Evening pass (Tue 15 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): a match was played, and it leads every surface.
  // Liverpool 3-1 Tottenham at Anfield, Carabao Cup third round, with TEN changes and Joe Gomez captaining
  // on a first appearance since a July muscle injury. Mac Allister into the top corner on 21; Gakpo the
  // second shortly after the interval; Gallagher headed Spurs back into it from a corner before the 70th;
  // Mamardashvili, in his first appearance of the season, made a significant late save; Szoboszlai, off the
  // bench, volleyed the third from around thirty yards in stoppage time. Andy Robertson came on for Udogie
  // on 57 and was given a standing ovation from all four stands on his first Anfield return. Fans also spotted
  // Iraola passing his own match notes down the bench to the academy players. First win since Ipswich and the
  // first time this season Liverpool have scored three. NO expected-goals figures had been published at the
  // time of writing, so the FORM_TRENDS card for this tie carries nulls with pending: true rather than an
  // estimate. NEXT_MATCH rolled to Bournemouth away, Sunday 20 September, 2pm at the Vitality, Sky Sports
  // Main Event, Andoni Iraola's first return to the club he managed until the summer; the OPPOSITION dossier
  // was rebuilt from scratch for Marco Rose's side, the first team in Premier League history to lead in each
  // of its opening four fixtures and win none of them. Fourth-round draw Wednesday night after Man Utd vs
  // Brighton, ties in the week beginning 26 October. STANDINGS byte-identical from ESPN, Liverpool eighth.
  // A thirty-yard volley IS a photographable moment under STEP 7.5, so a Track 1 plate was generated (the
  // strike, no text) and the Track 2 brief below is the open request for Antigravity. All eight generatedAt
  // stamps 22:45Z.
  // Morning pass (Tue 15 September, ~4am ET): MATCHDAY, but the match is tonight and has not been played, so there is no
  // new photographable moment yet. The Jacquet plate is carried again and generatedAt re-stamped; the `focus`/`brief`
  // below still describe the Fulham clearance, now the edition's background rather than its lead. The lead rotated off
  // Monday's press conference onto the tie itself: Tottenham at Anfield, 8pm, the Carabao Cup third round and Iraola's
  // first domestic cup tie, a heavily rotated XI (Koumas through the middle behind a returning Gakpo, Ngumoha and Munoz
  // wide, Nyoni and Mac Allister screening, Isak/Van Dijk/Szoboszlai/Wirtz rested), with Andy Robertson's first return to
  // Anfield in Tottenham colours the night's sub-plot. No new image queued under STEP 7.5 (a pre-match preview is not a
  // single still); Antigravity may generate a post-match hero image tonight if the tie produces one. Table unchanged from
  // ESPN, Liverpool eighth. All eight generatedAt stamps 08:30Z.
  // Evening pass (Mon 14 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): no match since Saturday, so the Jacquet plate is carried and
  // generatedAt re-stamped only. The `focus` line and `brief` below still describe the Fulham clearance, which is now the
  // third story on the page. The lead rotated to Iraola's Monday press conference at the AXA: Mamardashvili confirmed to
  // start (a first appearance of the season, the manager volunteering that he tried to sign him for Bournemouth), Gomez
  // upgraded from doubt to 'available for tomorrow', and the manager's own account of a schedule he called the worst
  // scenario. A press conference has no single still photograph in it, so NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5 and the
  // brief below is intentionally left at the last genuinely photographable moment; Antigravity should treat it as served.
  // Also this pass: Tottenham's team news reversed the weekend's reading (Tonali out with a knock, Porro and Kulusevski
  // out, Richarlison excluded from the squad entirely, Udogie back, Van de Ven in fact fit and a starter at Everton), and
  // the table moved without Liverpool playing, Leeds beating Newcastle 4-1 at Elland Road to go third and Liverpool
  // slipping from seventh to eighth on the same six points.
  // Machine-readable handoff written by the daily run, consumed by Antigravity.
  // Evening pass (Sat 12 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): a match was played. Liverpool 0-0 Fulham at Anfield,
  // the first blank under Iraola and a fourth straight Anfield league draw, the first such run since November
  // 2011 per Opta. Jacquet cleared Garcia's shot off the line on 12 after Alisson's short pass to a marked
  // Gravenberch (King's penalty appeal waved away); Munoz headed a corner against the bar on 22; Leno saved
  // from Isak and Mac Allister; Alisson tipped King's curler wide on 76; Muniz missed on 79. Opta: 1.13 xG from
  // 14 shots to 0.71 from 10. Three changes (Tsimikas, Gravenberch, Munoz) all withdrawn by the hour; Gakpo back
  // from the bench; Gomez not in the squad. Iraola: 'a lack of freshness, definitely, we cannot hide it'.
  // The result leads every surface. Next: Tottenham, Carabao Cup third round, Anfield, Tuesday 8pm, ITV and
  // Sky; NEXT_MATCH rolled forward and the OPPOSITION dossier rebuilt for De Zerbi's goalless side. A goal-line
  // clearance IS a photographable moment under STEP 7.5, so a Track 1 plate was generated (the clearance, no
  // text) and the Track 2 brief below is the open request for Antigravity (COVER-00001). The limn-editor-enhance
  // skill was not present on this mount, so the request is recorded here and in cover-brief.json only.
  // Morning pass (Sat 12 September): MATCHDAY. Fulham at Anfield today at 3pm; no match or ruling-out
  // since Wednesday's Atletico win, table byte-identical from ESPN. Lead rotated off Friday evening's
  // Ekitike-January anchor onto the fixture itself; Gakpo the lone doubt into matchday, Barcola and Kerkez
  // cleared, Gomez in line for a first bench. Mac Allister strike plate carried and re-stamped.
  // Morning pass (Sun 13 September, ~4am ET): no match since Saturday; table byte-identical from ESPN (the
  // Manchester derby is this afternoon, unplayed). Lead rotated off the Fulham result onto the Sunday-morning
  // reckoning on Iraola: 'officially under serious pressure' (AnfieldWatch/LiveScore/Yahoo) after one win in
  // four, with no sporting director (Hughes long gone to Al-Hilal, Gordon/FSG hunting a fifth since 2022), his
  // fuller 'what was lacking was quite clear' post-mortem, and Pablo Barrios (Atletico) the one new January/
  // summer midfield thread. NOT a sacking; contradiction sweep clean. A manager-pressure lead is not
  // photographable, so no new image queued; Jacquet clearance plate carried and generatedAt re-stamped.
  // Evening pass (Sun 13 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): no match since Saturday, so the Jacquet plate is carried
  // and generatedAt re-stamped only. NOTE: the `focus` line above and the `brief` below still describe the Fulham
  // clearance, which is now the SECOND story on the page, not the lead. The lead rotated to the captain's contract:
  // Liverpool will not open Van Dijk talks until 2027, no decision before April, the deal expiring that summer
  // (Football Insider, carried by Yahoo / CaughtOffside / Sports Mole). A contract that is deliberately not being
  // discussed has no single still photograph in it, so NO new image was queued under STEP 7.5 and the brief below
  // is intentionally left at the last genuinely photographable moment. Antigravity should treat it as already served.
  // The table moved without Liverpool playing: City won the derby with ten men, Brighton won 5-0 at Coventry,
  // Liverpool slip to seventh on the same six points.
  // Evening pass (Fri 11 September, 6pm ET / 11pm BST): no match since Wednesday. The lead moved to the one
  // new fact from Friday's briefing: Iraola put a January date, of sorts, on Ekitike's Achilles. Plate carried.
  // Evening pass (Wed 9 September): a match was played. Liverpool 2-1 Atletico Madrid at Anfield, the Champions
  // League opener: Llorente 17, Szoboszlai 40, Mac Allister 50. Opta: 1.68 xG from 14 shots to 0.81 from 9.
  // Track 1 plate 2026-09-09-mac-allister-strike.svg.
  // Evening pass (Sat 5 September): Richard Hughes stepped down as sporting director. Track 1 plate 2026-09-05-hughes-exit.svg.

  summary: "As of Tuesday night, Liverpool have beaten Villarreal 4-3 at Anfield after trailing 2-0 inside twenty-nine minutes, with Mac Allister scoring twice, Araujo heading the equaliser on the stroke of half-time and Wirtz, a half-time substitute, adding the fourth on sixty-eight; Oluwaseyi's goal on eighty-seven set up a nervous finish (Sky Sports). Rio Ngumoha made two of the goals and, at eighteen, became the third-youngest player to make multiple assists in a Champions League game (Opta Analyst), and the underlying numbers back the comeback: 2.37 expected goals to 1.58 from twenty-two shots to fourteen (Opta Analyst), though Villarreal led the first-half count 1.12 to 0.83 (Sofascore). It is three wins from three in the league phase, but Liverpool have now conceded three in each of their last two European games (Sky Sports), and Iraola told Prime his side have started to concede too many (YSscores). Muñoz was left out of the squad with an undisclosed injury and is aiming for Brighton at Anfield on Sunday at 2pm (RotoWire), the third-placed side and the next league test (Liverpool FC).",

  liverpoolAngle: "Brighton have conceded five league goals all season, and Liverpool have conceded six in two European games while scoring ten, so Sunday turns on whether this team can control a game rather than win a shoot-out. The right side is the obvious seam: Frimpong is out to November, Muñoz missed tonight's squad, and the half-time fix against Villarreal was to move Gravenberch, a midfielder, to right-back, which leaves the pivot short when Szoboszlai is still out (Evening Standard). Against a 4-2-3-1 that builds through its midfield, Gravenberch and Mac Allister are needed in the middle, so Araujo, who played only forty-five minutes tonight, is the likeliest right-back again. The reassurance is in tonight's second half, when Liverpool's ground-duel success rose to 73 per cent (Sofascore).",
