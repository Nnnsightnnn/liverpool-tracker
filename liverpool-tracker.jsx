On the schedule: 'It can take some time for us to adapt to that, but we need to do that as quick as we can because we don't have time to waste.'

Saturday: rested to the bench, back on at half-time because the man who replaced him could not finish it. Tsimikas misplaced 11 of 31 passes and was withdrawn; Kerkez came on to a 5 from Rousing The Kop, 'an improvement' without offering much, and 'yet more dreadful crossing' on the SI card. SI's verdict is that neither left-back is currently up to Iraola's standard.

With the club reported to be deferring Van Dijk's talks to 2027, the midfielder who says Liverpool will not renew him is no longer the outlier he looked last week. On for Gravenberch at 60 on Saturday and the midfield settled, a 7 and 'undroppable' by Rousing The Kop; he said last week Liverpool will not renew him, and the recruitment staff are already scouting Atletico's Pablo Barrios for a 2027 midfield he may not be part of.

Alisson's account of a press that could not function and Rousing The Kop's duel count both point at the hour he and Szoboszlai spent as a pair, and the start he had waited three games for lasted exactly that long. Dispossessed by Alisson's short pass for the Garcia chance, 'all at sea far too often' by Rousing The Kop's reading, a 3, and replaced by Mac Allister at 60 with the side better for it; SI called it 'yet another undercooked performance'.

'Arguably worse' than Gravenberch by Rousing The Kop's account, a 3: loose passes early, pressed hard by Fulham, none of six first-half ground duels won, a swipe at King that nearly gave a penalty, and set-pieces that did not land until the corner Munoz headed onto the bar.

Iraola's line that 'for sure he will have his moments' was set against Jamie Carragher's blunter reading over the weekend, that the midfielder is never going to play for this Liverpool side, in a Football365 write-up of the exchange.

The football underneath: the ten who did not unlock it. Two shots the wrong side of the right post and a scuffed third, a 4 from Rousing The Kop ('undercooked everything he touched'), a 7.4 on FotMob that noted fatigue after Wednesday and 'uncharacteristic technical errors'.
