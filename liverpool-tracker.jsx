Araujo has covered there for three straight league games out of position; Frimpong played it in the cup; Gomez, back on Tuesday, is the third body and the only specialist among them.", image: "https://resources.premierleague.com/premierleague/photos/players/110x140/p492777.png" },

Gravenberch was not among the names the cup reports carried, and the standing charge against the pivot is unchanged from Saturday: two of ten first-half ground duels won between him and Szoboszlai against Fulham, and a game that only settled when Mac Allister arrived on the hour. Bournemouth press high and turn the ball over in midfield deliberately, which makes Sunday a more literal examination than a cup tie could be.", image: "https://resources.premierleague.com/premierleague/photos/players/110x140/p441266.png" },

With Tottenham pressing for an equaliser at 2-1, Szoboszlai met the ball around thirty yards out and volleyed it past Dubravka in stoppage time, a finish EPL Index called worthy of deciding almost any contest and one that turned a tense evening into a 3-1.

Endo had played nothing across the first five competitive games, fourth in the midfield queue and left off the European squad, and the cup tie was the fixture the calendar reserved for him. His standing role is clearer than his position: the emergency fifth centre-half whenever that department thins, which with Gomez back and Leoni pencilled for mid-October is now less likely than it was a fortnight ago.", image: "https://resources.premierleague.com/premierleague/photos/players/110x140/p158983.png" },

Wirtz sat out the cup tie among ten changes after five competitive games without a goal or an assist, and watched Mac Allister score from the position a ten is meant to attack.

Isak sat out the cup tie having started all five competitive games, and Gakpo led the line and scored in his place. The underlying concern is the service rather than the striker: sixteen touches against Fulham, the second fewest for a Liverpool outfielder on record per the BBC, behind his own fourteen against Forest.
