The tour spell as senior keeper while Alisson rested is over, and with the Brazilian settled back in, the Georgian is back as deputy with the season underway. Liverpool still prefer to protect the asset with a loan rather than sell, and the longer-horizon thinking has not moved off him as a genuine number one somewhere", image: "https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/cutout/3yoja81757088527.png" },

Van Dijk spent Saturday lobbying publicly to keep Cody Gakpo, and by deadline night Gakpo had sat down with the ownership, cleared the air and stayed; the captain got the outcome he asked for, though the collapse of City's bid did the work rather than the speech. His own deal still runs only to 2027 and he repeats that there is no deadline on it, his focus the pitch. At 35 he remains the fixed point Iraola builds around, and with no defender bought before the market shut he is also, more than ever, the one the back four cannot do without", image: "https://resources.premierleague.com/premierleague/photos/players/110x140/p97032.png" },

Wednesday evening's previews stopped hedging: Sports Mole lists Gomez as Out and says he will sit out on Friday, the Evening Standard files him among the injured with Ekitike, Bradley and Leoni, and the Racing Post says he remains sidelined. The muscle injury from the Sunderland friendly on 26 July is now past the month Iraola always put on it, and he has trained fully this week without being risked. Fulham at Anfield on 12 September is the next realistic target. Until then the cover behind Van Dijk, Jacquet and the loanee Araujo is nobody, and the one body who could have covered Frimpong on the right stays in Kirkby", image: "https://resources.premierleague.com/premierleague/photos/players/110x140/p171287.png" },

A difficult debut year after the £45m move drew criticism, but with Robertson gone to Tottenham the left-back job is unambiguously his, and a clean summer under a new coach is the reset he needs. He landed in Chicago with the group", image: "https://resources.premierleague.com/premierleague/photos/players/110x140/p544877.png" },

Bradley is rehabilitating the knee he suffered against Arsenal in January, took no part in pre-season, and the club commit to no date; the reporting has eyed November, and Sports Mole now pencils the turn of the year. It matters more tonight because Joe Gomez, the one body who could have covered right-back in his absence, was ruled out of Ipswich by the previews, so Frimpong goes to Portman Road as the only fit senior right-back with Araujo, a centre-back, as the in-game alternative. A player the window could not replace, and the treatment room has not yet returned", image: "https://resources.premierleague.com/premierleague/photos/players/110x140/p492777.png" },

Gomez, the one internal cover at right-back, was ruled out of Ipswich in Wednesday's team news, Bradley remains months off, and the deadline-day Malo Gusto loan was refused, so Frimpong starts his third league game of the season as the only fit senior right-back with Araujo, a centre-back by trade, the in-game alternative. Ipswich's Abdul Fatawu, who beat Luke Shaw to make Leif Davis's goal at Old Trafford, is the first winger to test the arrangement. Fit if managed, still short of competition, and the position cannot do without him until January", image: "https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/cutout/ehf7fi1757088020.png" },

Leoni remains on ACL rehabilitation from the tear on his September 2025 debut, running on the outdoor pitches at the AXA Centre and understood since late July to be closer to a return than Bradley or Ekitike, both of whom Iraola calls way off. He is not in contention for Ipswich and Sports Mole puts his return no earlier than much later in the season. With Gomez ruled out of Friday, the senior centre-back cover is Van Dijk, Jacquet and the loanee Araujo, which is why an eighteen-year-old on a ten-month recovery is still being counted. The medical staff stay deliberately cautious with him", image: "https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/cutout/8aws9t1766829004.png" }, /* Leoni - TheSportsDB cutout */

Jacquet is set to start beside Van Dijk at Portman Road for a third league game, the Evening Standard noting he has been substituted twice in two matches for Ronald Araujo as he builds fitness after the shoulder problem managed since January surgery. With Gomez ruled out of Ipswich in Wednesday's team news and no defender bought, the loanee is the whole of the cover behind the pair, and Endo the emergency centre-half after that. A £60m twenty-year-old carrying the department the window left bare", image: "https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/cutout/d6qx171766136993.png" },

Ndukwe joined Levante on a season-long loan agreed on deadline day, the Spanish club covering his wage. Six foot six and nineteen, he was Liverpool's standout defender beside Van Dijk against Monaco in pre-season, but born in Austria and short of the points a post-Brexit work permit demands, he could not play a competitive fixture for Liverpool until at least January. A season abroad is the development the situation always called for: he goes to play now, rather than to wait", image: "https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/cutout/iagott1769030864.png" },

Mac Allister started against Forest alongside Szoboszlai, one of Iraola's two changes, with Gravenberch dropping out. Iraola has held brief talks with Mac Allister about his role in the 2026-27 side, resisting the summer's Madrid whispers and a fleeting City shortlist rather than banking him as sell-to-buy fuel. It caps a strange arc: a runner-up who played the length of the World Cup final at MetLife and lost it in extra time, Argentina down to ten after Enzo Fernandez's 93rd-minute red and beaten by Ferran Torres on 106, five weeks that rewrote a club season in which he was among the most criticised at Anfield. Back in training after missing the American tour, he anchors the midfield Iraola is building around through the Newcastle draw", image: "https://resources.premierleague.com/premierleague/photos/players/110x140/p243016.png" },
  { id: 14, name: "Ryan Gravenberch", number: 38, position: "MID", nationality: "🇳🇱 Netherlands", age: 23, appearances: 41, goals: 6, assists: 5, cleanSheets: null, xG: 3.1, tacklesPer90: 2.8, passCompletion: 91, progressiveCarries: 3.2, form: 7.2, status: "fit", injuryNote: "Sat Aug 29 — the fixed point, unfixed for an afternoon. Gravenberch was left out of the starting XI against Forest, Mac Allister taking his place beside Szoboszlai in one of two changes, and a side that has never held a lead this season conceded twice on the break without him. Gravenberch featured in the first-half spell that put Liverpool two up on Leeds before the reserves let the game slip to 2-4. Liverpool's most consistent player across a turbulent 2025-26 is the certainty at the base of whatever Iraola builds; everything around him is a question, he is not one of them", image: "https://resources.premierleague.com/premierleague/photos/players/110x140/p441266.png" },
  { id: 15, name: "Dominik Szoboszlai", number: 8, position: "MID", nationality: "🇭🇺 Hungary", age: 25, appearances: 49, goals: 13, assists: 9, cleanSheets: null, xG: 6.2, tacklesPer90: 2.1, passCompletion: 86, progressiveCarries: 2.8, form: 7.6, status: "fit", injuryNote: "Mon Aug 24 — the nerve that saved the opener. Szoboszlai buried a penalty in the ninth minute of stoppage time at Newcastle to rescue a 2-2 and hand Iraola a debut point, stepping up over Isak with Salah gone and the club's penalty order unsettled. A vice-captain under the new coach after his extension to 2031 and last season's supporters' player of the year, he is the composure the young side keeps leaning on. Fit, central, and now perhaps the man the manager simply names as his taker before the debate returns", image: "https://resources.premierleague.com/premierleague/photos/players/110x140/p424876.png" },
  { id: 17, name: "Wataru Endo", number: 3, position: "MID", nationality: "🇯🇵 Japan", age: 33, appearances: 14, goals: 0, assists: 1, cleanSheets: null, xG: 0.3, tacklesPer90: 3.1, passCompletion: 87, progressiveCarries: 1.2, form: 6.2, status: "fit", injuryNote: "Tue Sep 1 — the window shut and he is still here, which changes what he is for. Wolves, Fulham and West Ham all looked at the 33-year-old and none of them moved, so a player FSG were willing to sanction out stays as a senior midfield body in a squad that added none. That matters more than it did this morning: with Jones sold to Inter and nobody bought behind him, Endo is now the depth rather than the surplus, and the non-homegrown slot he occupies was cited all day as the reason no further arrival could be squeezed in. The February foot trouble is long behind him. Fit, available, and no longer for sale until January", image: "https://resources.premierleague.com/premierleague/photos/players/110x140/p158983.png" },

Wirtz scored Liverpool's second in Sunday's 2-3 defeat to Monaco and ran most of the side's attacks through him, the clearest evidence yet of why Iraola sees the £115m playmaker behind the striker as a No. 10. He shared barely 117 minutes with Isak and Ekitike across an injury-disrupted first year; a clean block of work, in his best position, is the reset, and its first month has been its brightest", image: "https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/cutout/8t6bzo1757088899.png" },
  { id: 20, name: "Trey Nyoni", number: 42, position: "MID", nationality: "🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 England", age: 17, appearances: 5, goals: 0, assists: 0, cleanSheets: null, xG: 0.2, tacklesPer90: 1.0, passCompletion: 84, progressiveCarries: 2.8, form: 6.0, status: "fit", injuryNote: "Tue Sep 1 — valued at thirty million pounds, and not for sale at any price. Nottingham Forest, hunting a midfielder since Elliot Anderson joined Manchester City, tabled £25m plus £5m in add-ons late on deadline day and were turned down flat. Paul Joyce reported Liverpool telling them the teenager is going nowhere at this stage of the window, the reasoning being that Curtis Jones's sale to Inter opened real minutes in front of him and Iraola trusted him repeatedly through pre-season. Talks over improved terms are now expected. Fit and available at Portman Road", image: "https://backend.liverpoolfc.com/sites/default/files/styles/xs/public/2025-08/trey-nyoni-2025-26-bodyshot_c04372ac9100f85a5647a0cd12e323c0.webp?itok=nTrwzG0A" },

With City's approach dead and Tottenham long gone, Gakpo held clear-the-air talks with the ownership on deadline day and stays, contracted to 2030, the summer's most public tug-of-war settled by conversation. Supporters largely backed him through a window the reporting has been calling farcical for a fortnight. An assist and an equaliser-maker across his two league games, he is among the fittest attacking options Iraola takes to Portman Road, and one of the very few players at the club whose future nobody is still asking about", image: "https://resources.premierleague.com/premierleague/photos/players/110x140/p243298.png" },

Isak's £125m still stands as Liverpool's largest fee, with Barcola's guaranteed £106m rising to £123m second on the club's list, but Manchester City agreed £125m with Chelsea for Enzo Fernandez before the deadline and drew level at the top of the English market. On the pitch he is off the mark: his first of the season on the hour against Forest, standing where a centre-forward stands when Gakpo spins his marker and clips one to the back post. Good to take something from the game, he said, but they need to be better. With Ekitike out until December and nobody bought behind him, the goals have nowhere else to come from", image: "https://resources.premierleague.com/premierleague/photos/players/110x140/p219168.png" },

Iraola's first in-season bulletin offered no comfort on the striker Liverpool most miss: the Achilles ruptured against PSG in April keeps Ekitike sidelined, the coach 'talking about months and still a lot of time out' and conceding he may not feature again this calendar year. He continues his rehabilitation away from the group, took no part in pre-season, and is at best a hopeful festive-period return. The front line carries on without its most productive option from last term's 18 goals", image: "https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/cutout/8za47v1757087851.png" },

The previews had Ngumoha starting on his birthday; Iraola gave the right flank to Victor Munoz instead, and the substitute watched the Spaniard hit the equaliser that saved the afternoon. The new five-year deal with a significant rise is still there to sign, delayed only by the rule capping under-18s at three-year terms, a formality that clears now he has turned eighteen. Nothing about a competitive selection call at a club with a £123m winger arriving says the path has closed.

He has yet to feature this season, having played as a central striker in pre-season under Iraola. The exit talk died on deadline night when his father said publicly that Federico is not thinking about leaving, so he stays, the only natural right-sided option in a squad Carragher says has four left wingers, and unavailable to prove it", image: "https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/cutout/idecla1757087689.png" },
